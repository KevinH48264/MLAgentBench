Question 2: Have you applied any outlier removal or normalization techniques to the numerical features in the dataset?\n In the provided code, several preprocessing steps have been applied to the numerical features in the dataset, which are important for building a robust machine learning model. Here\'s a breakdown of the key techniques used:  Feature Engineering: New features like \'Age\' and \'YearsSinceRemodel\' are created based on existing columns. This is a form of feature engineering, which can help in making the dataset more informative for the model.  Imputation: The numerical transformer pipeline uses SimpleImputer(strategy=\'mean\') to fill missing values in numerical columns with the mean of the respective columns. This is a common practice to handle missing data and ensure that the model doesn\'t face input issues due to NaN values.  Normalization: The numerical transformer pipeline also includes StandardScaler(), which standardizes the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This normalization technique is crucial when features have different scales, as it makes the model less sensitive to the scale of features.  However, there are no explicit outlier removal techniques applied in the provided code. Outlier removal is a process where data points that are significantly different from most of the other data points are removed. While this can sometimes improve model performance, it also risks losing valuable information, especially if "outliers" are actually important signals rather than noise.  In summary, the code includes feature engineering, imputation, and normalization techniques for numerical features but does not explicitly include outlier removal.

Question 3: Have you tried different imputation methods for handling missing data, and if so, which methods did you try?\nSpecifically, it uses two different strategies for imputing missing values:  Mean Imputation for Numerical Data: This method involves replacing missing values in numerical columns with the mean of the available values in those columns. This is implemented in your code with the SimpleImputer(strategy=\'mean\') within the numerical_transformer pipeline.  Most Frequent Value Imputation for Categorical Data: For categorical data, your model uses the most frequent value (mode) to impute missing values. This is achieved using SimpleImputer(strategy=\'most_frequent\') within the categorical_transformer pipeline.  These are common and effective strategies for handling missing data, especially when the proportion of missing data is not too high. However, there are other methods you might consider, depending on the nature and extent of the missing data in your dataset:  Median Imputation: Similar to mean imputation, but uses the median value. This can be more robust to outliers than the mean.  Constant Value Imputation: Filling missing values with a constant value, which could be a standard value or a value that indicates missing data (like 0 or -1 for numerical features).  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation: This method imputes missing values based on the K nearest neighbors, where K is a parameter.  Iterative Imputation or Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE): This is a more sophisticated approach where each feature with missing values is modeled conditionally upon the other features, and imputation is done iteratively round-robin style.  Random Forest Imputation: Using random forest algorithms to predict and impute missing values.  Each of these methods has its pros and cons, and the choice of method should be based on the specific characteristics of your data and the missingness mechanism (MCAR, MAR, or MNAR - Missing Completely At Random, Missing At Random, Missing Not At Random). For instance, mean/median imputation doesn\'t capture the potential variability in the missing values, while model-based methods like KNN or MICE can be more computationally intensive but might provide more accurate imputations.

Question 4: Have you experimented with different values of k for SelectKBest, and if so, what range of values have you tried?\nNo I just tried k=150

Question 5: What range of k values for SelectKBest could you experiment with, and could you implement cross-validation to find the optimal value for k?\nI tried all these k_values: k_values = range(10, len(categorical_cols) + 1, 10) and got the best k value: 40
