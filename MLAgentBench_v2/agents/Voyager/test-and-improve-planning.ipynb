      "I finished reading data_description.txt. I think I already have the research problem in research_problem.txt. I finished getting the description statistics, and I wrote a plan to get handle missing values in train.csv. I executed the script handle_missing_values.py and now have a train_cleaned.csv that looks like it's got values in it. I wrote a plan to encode categorical variables. I wrote a script for categorical encoding, and it successfully outputted a train_encoded.csv file. I created a plan for regression model training. I executed the regression model training and got a MAE of 17700.351130136984. Then, I analyzed feature importance, and completed feature engineering and produced a train_engineered.csv file. Then, I created a plan for hyperparameter tuning. I then executed the hyperparameter tuning plan and got the following output: Best Hyperparameters: {'n_estimators': 500, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'max_depth': 20}\n",
      "Mean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17274.369739142738. Then, I created a plan for potentially improving the current model's performance. Then, I implemented advanced feature engineering by adding interaction terms and polynomial features, creating new features in the dataset and retraining the model to evaluate if the MAE is reduced below 11,000. This was the MAE: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16976.402743429742. Then I implemented refined hyperparameter tuning around the best hyperparameters found, and I got the following:\n",
      "Refined Best Hyperparameters: {'max_depth': 15, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 550}\n",
      "Mean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17266.691320088325. Then I tried out gradient boosting and got the following MAE: Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set: 17179.78904113612 and XGBoost and got the following MAE: XGBoost MAE on Validation Set: 17668.19214201627. I just finished ensuring prepreprocessing steps applied to training data are also correctly applied to the test data. There is now a test_preprocessed.csv. I tried to write a test_predict.py script but then I realized I didn't have a model saved as model.pkl so I don't know what model to use, and I also didn't have a model with a MAE of less than 11,000 so it wasn't clear which model to use too. I wrote a plan for exploring ensemble methods such as stacking in stacking_gb_xgboost_plan.txt. I executed the stacking ensemble method, but got the following ouput: Stacked Model MAE on Validation Set: 17393.148801933337. Failure: The stacked model's MAE is not below 11,000. I tried to experiment with different feature selection methods and wrote feature_selection.py with the code below, but got a MAE of 17837 which is still higher than 11,000. I experimented with L1-based feature selection to identify a more predictive subset and features and got Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set with L1-Selected Features: 32244.060640592466. I then used the advanced_feature_engineer.py model because that has the lowest MAE and I added code to save the model as a pkl file and executed the code. Then, I used that model for the analyze_errors.py script. I produced visualizations to analyze the error distribution and tried to idetnfiy specific patterns and their correlation to error. There's a analyze_errors_summary.txt file was created and summarizes an analysis of the errors and types of properties where the model's predictions are less accurate. I created advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16549.762519474294. I tried to refine feature engineering by writing an advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py based on error anlaysis insights. However, I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16867.688131983028. I further reflected on the error analysis for additional insights in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I then implemented outlier detection using an algorithm like Isolation Forest on GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF, and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Outlier Detection: 15505.041583375516. I then tried implementing segmentation-based modeling by creating separate models for different segments of the data, specifically targetting high-quality houses and properties with alrger living areas and basements. I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error for HighQualityLargeProperties: 51059.29307922336. Model for HighQualityLargeProperties rejected due to high MAE. I reflected on the error analysis insights and put my reflections in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I implemented skewness correction in skewness_correction.py by applying a log transformation to the SalePrice target variable. I retrained the outlier detection model because that was the best model so far using the log transformed target variable and got a MAE of 16478. I then tried to apply robust scaling to features with potential outliers or heavy tails, but I got Mean Absolute Error after Robust Scaling: 17111.915956794848. I reviewed the error analysis again and identified at least one actionable insight to potentially reduce the MAE. I then wrote a 'targeted_feature_engineering.py' to implement new features focusing on high-value and large properties and got Mean Absolute Error after Targeted Feature Engineering: 13978.312204170952. I then tried to refine the targeted feature engineering in the targeted_feature_engineering.py script by adjusting the thresholds for defining high-quality and large properties and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Adjusted Targeted Feature Engineering: 16477.\n",

I executed the regression model training and got a MAE of 17700.351130136984. Then, I analyzed feature importance, and completed feature engineering and produced a train_engineered.csv file.

      "Outlier Detection and Treatment: Since large errors may indicate outliers, applying outlier detection algorithms to identify and treat these can improve model performance. You could use methods like Isolation Forest or DBSCAN to detect outliers in features such as GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segmentation-Based Modeling: Given that the model's performance varies by quality and size, consider segmenting the dataset into groups (e.g., high-quality homes, average homes, large homes) and developing separate models for each segment. This approach can tailor the model to specific data distributions and may improve overall accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Error Correlation Analysis: Conduct a deeper analysis to see if errors correlate with other features that haven't been considered yet. For example, the age of the property, its location, or proximity to amenities could play a significant role and provide insight into additional features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advanced Non-linear Features: The analysis suggests that the relationship between features like OverallQual and GrLivArea with the target variable may be non-linear. Investigating more complex non-linear transformations or kernel methods might capture these relationships better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Temporal Dynamics: If the dataset spans a significant time period, consider the impact of market trends over time. Features capturing the temporal aspect, like 'year sold' or 'month sold', could help account for inflation or housing market fluctuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feature Interaction Complexity: The current polynomial feature generation might not be capturing the complexity of interactions adequately. Explore higher-degree interactions for the most important features or use feature learning techniques like autoencoders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enhanced Feature Scaling: If features are on very different scales, especially after creating new ones, ensure robust scaling methods are used. Features with larger scales may dominate the model, so consider normalization or standardization techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "Model Ensembling: Since different models capture various aspects of the data, combining the predictions of multiple models (e.g., stacking, blending) might yield better performance than any single model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human-in-the-loop: Sometimes, domain experts can provide insights that are not immediately obvious from the data. Consultation with real estate experts could reveal factors influencing house prices that have not been encoded in the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feature Engineering Based on Errors: Create new features based on the residuals of the current model. For instance, if certain types of properties are consistently under or overestimated, a feature capturing this tendency could help the model self-correct.\n",

      "1. **Distribution of Prediction Errors**:\n",
      "   - The histogram of prediction errors shows a bell-shaped distribution, which suggests that most predictions are close to the actual values, with fewer occurrences of large errors.\n",
      "   - However, there is a noticeable skew in the distribution, indicating that there are more underestimations (negative error values) than overestimations (positive error values).\n",
      "   - The presence of errors with large magnitudes suggests potential outliers or instances where the model significantly mispredicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Error vs. GrLivArea**:\n",
      "   - The scatter plot relating prediction errors to `GrLivArea` (above-ground living area square feet) shows a pattern where larger errors are more common in properties with larger living areas.\n",
      "   - There doesn't appear to be a consistent trend or bias across the range of `GrLivArea`, but it's evident that the prediction error variability increases with the size of the living area.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Error vs. OverallQual**:\n",
      "   - The plot against `OverallQual` (rates the overall material and finish of the house) indicates that houses with higher quality ratings tend to have larger positive prediction errors, meaning the model underestimates their prices.\n",
      "   - There's a noticeable concentration of errors around the middle quality ratings (5-7), suggesting that the model may be more accurate for average-quality homes compared to high-quality ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Error vs. TotalBsmtSF**:\n",
      "   - The relationship between prediction errors and `TotalBsmtSF` (total square feet of basement area) does not show a clear pattern.\n",
      "   - However, similar to `GrLivArea`, there is an indication that larger basement areas could be associated with larger errors, though the data is quite scattered.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion for Task Completion**:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model seems to perform relatively well for properties with average-quality ratings and smaller living areas. However, it tends to underestimate the prices for higher-quality houses and shows increasing variability in prediction errors as the living area and basement size increase. These areas could be where the model is underperforming and may benefit from further investigation or model adjustments, such as feature engineering specific to high-quality houses or handling outliers in larger homes. To improve the model, additional features that capture the nuances of higher-end properties or further tuning of the model to reduce variance in larger homes could be helpful.\n",

Key areas for improvement include exploring different feature selection methods, such as univariate selection or recursive feature elimination, and reconsidering the threshold used in SelectFromModel for a more optimal feature subset. Additionally, the Gradient Boosting model may require re-tuning of hyperparameters post-feature selection to better suit the reduced feature set. Experimenting with different models, including revisiting stacking ensembles with varied base models or meta-learners, could also potentially enhance performance.

Here is a list of potential improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Advanced Feature Engineering\n",
      "Feature Interaction Expansion: Expand the current set of interaction terms. Experiment with different degrees in PolynomialFeatures.\n",
      "Feature Selection: Employ techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify and keep only the most impactful features.\n",
      "Domain-Specific Features: If domain knowledge is available, create new features that could be relevant in predicting house prices (e.g., total area, age of the property).\n",
      "Temporal Features: If date or time-related features are present, extract more granular features (e.g., year, month, day, seasonality).\n",

      "Increase Model Complexity: Since RandomForest is robust to overfitting, try increasing max_depth or n_estimators further, if computational resources allow.\n",

      "Refined Grid Search: Conduct a more focused grid search around the best hyperparameters found (n_estimators: 500, max_depth: 20, etc.).\n",
      "Bayesian Optimization: Use Bayesian optimization methods for a more efficient hyperparameter search than Grid or Random search.\n",
      "4. Ensemble Methods\n",
      "Stacking: Combine multiple different models using stacking techniques. The blend of models might capture different aspects of the data.\n",
      "Boosting Algorithms: Try boosting algorithms like XGBoost, GradientBoostingRegressor, or LightGBM, which can often yield better performance.\n",
      "5. Additional Data Preprocessing\n",
      "Outlier Removal: Investigate and potentially remove outliers that could be adversely affecting model performance.\n",
      "Handling Skewed Data: Apply transformations like log, square root, or Box-Cox to features that are highly skewed.\n",
      "6. Cross-Validation Strategy\n",
      "Fine-Tuning Cross-Validation: Adjust the cross-validation strategy, such as trying different numbers of folds, to ensure the model is generalizing well.\n",
      "7. Deep Learning (If Applicable)\n",
      "Neural Networks: If the dataset is large and complex enough, experimenting with neural networks could be beneficial, although this requires significant computational resources.\n",
      "8. Error Analysis\n",
      "Analyze Residuals: Dive deeper into the model's residuals to understand where it's making errors and if there's a pattern.\n",

      "a. One-Hot Encoding\n",
      "Applicability: Suitable for nominal variables with low cardinality.\n",
      "Method: Create a new binary column for each category.\n",

      "Method: Replace categories with the mean of the target variable for each category.\n",

      "Flagging: For columns where missingness is informative (MNAR), create a new binary column indicating the presence or absence of data.\n",

But this playground competition\\'s dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.\\n\\nWith 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.\\n\\nEvaluation\\nGoal\\nIt is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. You want a train and validation MAE of lower than 15,000 and there should be a submission.csv containing predictions for test.csv ready to submit.\\n\\nMetric\\nSubmissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)\\n\\nSubmission File Format\\nThe file should contain a header and have the following format:\\n\\nId,SalePrice\\n1461,169000.1\\n1462,187724.1233\\n1463,175221\\netc.\\n\\nI will give you the following information:\\nFiles: these are my current files and skills that I have in my working directory.\\nCompleted tasks so far (most recent to least): ...\\nFailed tasks that are too hard (most recent to least): ...\\nMost recent attempted tasks, plans, results, and answer states (newest to oldest): Answer states are the report of the best answer I have so far to achieving the research goal, and the attempted tasks, plans, results, and files are the tasks, plans, results, and files I took and had at that point in time to update the answer state.\\n\\n1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress. Always give me the task that will help me learn the most and reach my research goal the fastest.\\n2) Please be very specific about what information or actions I need to take and what expected results I need to achieve. Always include a brief acceptance criteria and rejection criteria for the task.\\n3) The next task should follow a clear format, such as \"Write [file]\", \"Reflect on why I\\'m seeing [error]\", \"Read [file]\", \"Brainstorm if ideas from [topic 1] be applied to [topic 2]\", \"Analyze what are the similarities between [topic 1] for success and [topic 2]\" , \"Reflect on what\\'s significant about this paper: [paper]?\", \"Reflect on what\\'s currently missing or preventing me from achieving [goal] better\", etc. It should be a single task to collect useful information on. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else. Please include a brief acceptance criteria and rejection criteria for the task.\\n4) The next task should not be too hard since the internet and I may not contain the full answer in a single article or have learned enough information to complete it yet. \\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting based on my current learning progress. I should look for rare and potentially useful pieces of information, upgrade my current answer using better information, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks or variations of the task if I need to collect more information to answer more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary. \\n7) I want to explore the world and discover new things.

prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: The plan should include refining the targeted feature engineering approach, retraining the model, evaluating the MAE, and if successful, preparing the submission.csv file.\\n\\nI finished reading data_description.txt. I think I already have the research problem in research_problem.txt. I finished getting the description statistics, and I wrote a plan to get handle missing values in train.csv. I executed the script handle_missing_values.py and now have a train_cleaned.csv that looks like it\\'s got values in it. I wrote a plan to encode categorical variables. I wrote a script for categorical encoding, and it successfully outputted a train_encoded.csv file. I created a plan for regression model training. I executed the regression model training and got a MAE of 17700.351130136984. Then, I analyzed feature importance, and completed feature engineering and produced a train_engineered.csv file. Then, I created a plan for hyperparameter tuning. I then executed the hyperparameter tuning plan and got the following output: Best Hyperparameters: {\\'n_estimators\\': 500, \\'min_samples_split\\': 2, \\'min_samples_leaf\\': 1, \\'max_features\\': \\'sqrt\\', \\'max_depth\\': 20}\\nMean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17274.369739142738. Then, I created a plan for potentially improving the current model\\'s performance. Then, I implemented advanced feature engineering by adding interaction terms and polynomial features, creating new features in the dataset and retraining the model to evaluate if the MAE is reduced below 11,000. This was the MAE: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16976.402743429742. Then I implemented refined hyperparameter tuning around the best hyperparameters found, and I got the following:\\nRefined Best Hyperparameters: {\\'max_depth\\': 15, \\'max_features\\': \\'sqrt\\', \\'min_samples_leaf\\': 1, \\'min_samples_split\\': 2, \\'n_estimators\\': 550}\\nMean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17266.691320088325. Then I tried out gradient boosting and got the following MAE: Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set: 17179.78904113612 and XGBoost and got the following MAE: XGBoost MAE on Validation Set: 17668.19214201627. I just finished ensuring prepreprocessing steps applied to training data are also correctly applied to the test data. There is now a test_preprocessed.csv. I tried to write a test_predict.py script but then I realized I didn\\'t have a model saved as model.pkl so I don\\'t know what model to use, and I also didn\\'t have a model with a MAE of less than 11,000 so it wasn\\'t clear which model to use too. I wrote a plan for exploring ensemble methods such as stacking in stacking_gb_xgboost_plan.txt. I executed the stacking ensemble method, but got the following ouput: Stacked Model MAE on Validation Set: 17393.148801933337. Failure: The stacked model\\'s MAE is not below 11,000. I tried to experiment with different feature selection methods and wrote feature_selection.py with the code below, but got a MAE of 17837 which is still higher than 11,000. I experimented with L1-based feature selection to identify a more predictive subset and features and got Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set with L1-Selected Features: 32244.060640592466. I then used the advanced_feature_engineer.py model because that has the lowest MAE and I added code to save the model as a pkl file and executed the code. Then, I used that model for the analyze_errors.py script. I produced visualizations to analyze the error distribution and tried to idetnfiy specific patterns and their correlation to error. There\\'s a analyze_errors_summary.txt file was created and summarizes an analysis of the errors and types of properties where the model\\'s predictions are less accurate. I created advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16549.762519474294. I tried to refine feature engineering by writing an advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py based on error anlaysis insights. However, I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16867.688131983028. I further reflected on the error analysis for additional insights in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I then implemented outlier detection using an algorithm like Isolation Forest on GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF, and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Outlier Detection: 15505.041583375516. I then tried implementing segmentation-based modeling by creating separate models for different segments of the data, specifically targetting high-quality houses and properties with alrger living areas and basements. I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error for HighQualityLargeProperties: 51059.29307922336. Model for HighQualityLargeProperties rejected due to high MAE. I reflected on the error analysis insights and put my reflections in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I implemented skewness correction in skewness_correction.py by applying a log transformation to the SalePrice target variable. I retrained the outlier detection model because that was the best model so far using the log transformed target variable and got a MAE of 16478. I then tried to apply robust scaling to features with potential outliers or heavy tails, but I got Mean Absolute Error after Robust Scaling: 17111.915956794848. I reviewed the error analysis again and identified at least one actionable insight to potentially reduce the MAE. I then wrote a \\'targeted_feature_engineering.py\\' to implement new features focusing on high-value and large properties and got Mean Absolute Error after Targeted Feature Engineering: 13978.312204170952. I then tried to refine the targeted feature engineering in the targeted_feature_engineering.py script by adjusting the thresholds for defining high-quality and large properties and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Adjusted Targeted Feature Engineering: 16477.\\n\\nHere is the code for targeted_feature_engineering_v2.py: \\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\\nimport joblib\\n\\n# Load the dataset\\ndf = pd.read_csv(\\'train_encoded.csv\\')\\n\\n# Assume \\'SalePrice\\' is the target variable\\ntarget = \\'SalePrice\\'\\n\\n# Separate features and target\\nX = df.drop(target, axis=1)\\ny = df[target]\\n\\n# Adjust thresholds for high-quality and large properties\\nquality_threshold = X[\\'OverallQual\\'].quantile(0.95)  # Adjusted from 0.9 to 0.85\\nsize_threshold = X[\\'GrLivArea\\'].quantile(0.95)      # Adjusted from 0.9 to 0.85\\n\\n# Create new features targeting adjusted high-quality houses and larger properties\\nX[\\'HighQuality\\'] = (X[\\'OverallQual\\'] > quality_threshold).astype(int)\\nX[\\'LargeProperty\\'] = (X[\\'GrLivArea\\'] > size_threshold).astype(int)\\nX[\\'Quality_Size_Interaction\\'] = X[\\'HighQuality\\'] * X[\\'LargeProperty\\']\\nX[\\'Quality_GrLivArea\\'] = X[\\'HighQuality\\'] * X[\\'GrLivArea\\']\\nX[\\'Quality_TotalBsmtSF\\'] = X[\\'HighQuality\\'] * X[\\'TotalBsmtSF\\']\\n\\n# Polynomial features\\npoly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, include_bias=False, interaction_only=True)\\nX_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)\\nX_poly_df = pd.DataFrame(X_poly, columns=poly.get_feature_names_out(X.columns))\\n\\n# Impute missing values\\nimputer = SimpleImputer(strategy=\\'mean\\')\\nX_poly_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X_poly_df)\\n\\n# Split into training and validation sets\\nX_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X_poly_imputed, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\\n\\n# Initialize the RandomForestRegressor with the best hyperparameters\\nmodel = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=500, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1, max_features=\\'sqrt\\', max_depth=20, random_state=42)\\n\\n# Train the model on the enhanced dataset\\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\\n\\n# Predict on the validation set\\npredictions = model.predict(X_valid)\\n\\n# Evaluate the model using Mean Absolute Error\\nmae = mean_absolute_error(y_valid, predictions)\\n\\nprint(f\"Mean Absolute Error after Adjusted Targeted Feature Engineering: {mae}\")\\n\\n# Save the model if MAE is improved\\nif mae < 13978.312204170952:  # Replace with previous MAE\\n    model_filename = \\'model_with_adjusted_targeted_feature_engineering.pkl\\'\\n    joblib.dump(model, model_filename)\\n    print(f\"Model saved as {model_filename}\")\\n\\n\\nStep 28:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1.

Implement these improvements and retrain the outlier detection model. 3. Evaluate the model to check if the MAE is below 11,000. 4. If the MAE is below 11,000, save the model and predict on test_preprocessed.csv. 5. Prepare the submission.csv file ensuring it meets the competition\\'s format requirements.\\n\\nI finished reading data_description.txt. I think I already have the research problem in research_problem.txt. I finished getting the description statistics, and I wrote a plan to get handle missing values in train.csv. I executed the script handle_missing_values.py and now have a train_cleaned.csv that looks like it\\'s got values in it. I wrote a plan to encode categorical variables. I wrote a script for categorical encoding, and it successfully outputted a train_encoded.csv file. I created a plan for regression model training. I executed the regression model training and got a MAE of 17700.351130136984. Then, I analyzed feature importance, and completed feature engineering and produced a train_engineered.csv file. Then, I created a plan for hyperparameter tuning. I then executed the hyperparameter tuning plan and got the following output: Best Hyperparameters: {\\'n_estimators\\': 500, \\'min_samples_split\\': 2, \\'min_samples_leaf\\': 1, \\'max_features\\': \\'sqrt\\', \\'max_depth\\': 20}\\nMean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17274.369739142738. Then, I created a plan for potentially improving the current model\\'s performance. Then, I implemented advanced feature engineering by adding interaction terms and polynomial features, creating new features in the dataset and retraining the model to evaluate if the MAE is reduced below 11,000. This was the MAE: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16976.402743429742. Then I implemented refined hyperparameter tuning around the best hyperparameters found, and I got the following:\\nRefined Best Hyperparameters: {\\'max_depth\\': 15, \\'max_features\\': \\'sqrt\\', \\'min_samples_leaf\\': 1, \\'min_samples_split\\': 2, \\'n_estimators\\': 550}\\nMean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17266.691320088325. Then I tried out gradient boosting and got the following MAE: Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set: 17179.78904113612 and XGBoost and got the following MAE: XGBoost MAE on Validation Set: 17668.19214201627. I just finished ensuring prepreprocessing steps applied to training data are also correctly applied to the test data. There is now a test_preprocessed.csv. I tried to write a test_predict.py script but then I realized I didn\\'t have a model saved as model.pkl so I don\\'t know what model to use, and I also didn\\'t have a model with a MAE of less than 11,000 so it wasn\\'t clear which model to use too. I wrote a plan for exploring ensemble methods such as stacking in stacking_gb_xgboost_plan.txt. I executed the stacking ensemble method, but got the following ouput: Stacked Model MAE on Validation Set: 17393.148801933337. Failure: The stacked model\\'s MAE is not below 11,000. I tried to experiment with different feature selection methods and wrote feature_selection.py with the code below, but got a MAE of 17837 which is still higher than 11,000. I experimented with L1-based feature selection to identify a more predictive subset and features and got Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set with L1-Selected Features: 32244.060640592466. I then used the advanced_feature_engineer.py model because that has the lowest MAE and I added code to save the model as a pkl file and executed the code. Then, I used that model for the analyze_errors.py script. I produced visualizations to analyze the error distribution and tried to idetnfiy specific patterns and their correlation to error. There\\'s a analyze_errors_summary.txt file was created and summarizes an analysis of the errors and types of properties where the model\\'s predictions are less accurate. I created advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16549.762519474294. I tried to refine feature engineering by writing an advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py based on error anlaysis insights. However, I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16867.688131983028. I further reflected on the error analysis for additional insights in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I then implemented outlier detection using an algorithm like Isolation Forest on GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF, and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Outlier Detection: 15505.041583375516. I then tried implementing segmentation-based modeling by creating separate models for different segments of the data, specifically targetting high-quality houses and properties with alrger living areas and basements. I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error for HighQualityLargeProperties: 51059.29307922336. Model for HighQualityLargeProperties rejected due to high MAE. I reflected on the error analysis insights and put my reflections in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I implemented skewness correction in skewness_correction.py by applying a log transformation to the SalePrice target variable. I retrained the outlier detection model because that was the best model so far using the log transformed target variable and got a MAE of 16478. I then tried to apply robust scaling to features with potential outliers or heavy tails, but I got Mean Absolute Error after Robust Scaling: 17111.915956794848.

However, given the specific insights from the error analysis:\\n\\nDifferentiated Treatment for High-Value Properties: The model tends to underestimate the prices for higher-quality houses. This suggests that high-quality or high-value properties might follow a different pricing pattern than the rest of the dataset. Therefore, creating features that specifically cater to this segment can be beneficial. For example, introducing interaction terms that combine high-quality indicators (like top-tier OverallQual) with other significant features (like GrLivArea) might help the model better capture the nuances of high-value property pricing.\\n\\nCustomized Treatment for Large Properties: Similarly, for properties with larger living areas (GrLivArea) and basements (TotalBsmtSF), the model\\'s prediction variability increases. Here, developing size-specific features or even a separate sub-model for large properties could be useful. For instance, introducing a binary feature indicating whether a property is above a certain size threshold and using it in interaction with other key features might help.\\n\\nIn both cases, the focus should be on understanding and modeling the unique characteristics of these specific segments, as they appear to be the main source of larger prediction errors. This targeted approach could be more effective than general feature engineering strategies and might bring the MAE below the desired threshold of 11,000.\\n\\nStep 27:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1.

Implement a skewness correction for target variable (e.g., log transformation of SalePrice) to better capture high-value property prices.\\n\\nGrLivArea Error Variability:\\n\\nSize Premium Feature: Add a feature that represents the \\'premium\\' for larger properties, which could be an interaction term between GrLivArea and a binary feature indicating if the property is above a certain size threshold.\\nNon-linear Transformation: Apply non-linear transformations to GrLivArea (e.g., square root or logarithm) to potentially reduce the impact of extreme values.\\nOverallQual Underestimation:\\n\\nQuality-Size Interaction: Since higher quality ratings lead to underestimation, consider an interaction feature between OverallQual and GrLivArea or TotalBsmtSF to capture the combined effect of quality and size on price.\\nHigh-Quality Flag: Introduce a binary feature that flags the top-tier quality houses (e.g., OverallQual in the top 10%).\\nTotalBsmtSF Error Pattern:\\n\\nBasement Finish Quality: If not already included, add a feature representing the finish quality or condition of the basement, which can affect property value significantly.\\nBasement Size Binning: Use binning or categorization to create discrete basement size groups, which could help the model differentiate between typical and atypically large basements.\\nError Residual Features: Create new features based on the residuals of the current model predictions. For instance, a feature that captures the magnitude and direction of past errors for similar properties.\\n\\nOutlier Adjustment: Rather than removing outliers, implement a method to adjust the outlier target values closer to the prediction boundary, which could be a soft capping or a Winsorizing technique.\\n\\nSegmented Model Refinement: For segmented models, ensure that the feature set is optimized for each segment. Different segments may have different predictors that are important.\\n\\nModel Complexity for High-End Houses: High-end properties may have more complex features influencing their prices. For such segments, consider more complex models or increase the depth and number of estimators in the RandomForestRegressor.\\n\\nCross-Validation by Segments: Perform cross-validation within each segment to ensure that the model\\'s hyperparameters are tuned correctly for that specific subset of the data.\\n\\nTemporal Features for Market Trend: Add features that capture the market trend at the time of sale to account for economic factors affecting house prices.\\n\\nThese insights are aimed at reducing systematic errors and improving the model\\'s prediction across different segments of the housing market, particularly for high-quality and larger properties. Implementing these changes requires careful consideration to prevent overfitting while addressing the specific error patterns identified.\\n\\nStep 24:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1. Implement segmentation-based modeling by dividing the dataset into meaningful segments (e.g., high-quality homes, average homes, large homes). 2. Develop separate models for each segment. 3. Evaluate each model to check if the MAE is below 11,000. 4. If the MAE is below 11,000 for all segments, combine the segment-specific models for final predictions. 5.

I further reflected on the error anlaysis for additional insights in error_analysis_reflection.txt.\\n\\nContent in error_analysis_reflection.txt:\\nReflecting on the error analysis provided, here are additional insights and actionable steps that could refine the feature engineering or modeling process:\\n\\nOutlier Detection and Treatment: Since large errors may indicate outliers, applying outlier detection algorithms to identify and treat these can improve model performance. You could use methods like Isolation Forest or DBSCAN to detect outliers in features such as GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF.\\n\\nSegmentation-Based Modeling: Given that the model\\'s performance varies by quality and size, consider segmenting the dataset into groups (e.g., high-quality homes, average homes, large homes) and developing separate models for each segment. This approach can tailor the model to specific data distributions and may improve overall accuracy.\\n\\nError Correlation Analysis: Conduct a deeper analysis to see if errors correlate with other features that haven\\'t been considered yet. For example, the age of the property, its location, or proximity to amenities could play a significant role and provide insight into additional features.\\n\\nAdvanced Non-linear Features: The analysis suggests that the relationship between features like OverallQual and GrLivArea with the target variable may be non-linear. Investigating more complex non-linear transformations or kernel methods might capture these relationships better.\\n\\nTemporal Dynamics: If the dataset spans a significant time period, consider the impact of market trends over time. Features capturing the temporal aspect, like \\'year sold\\' or \\'month sold\\', could help account for inflation or housing market fluctuations.\\n\\nFeature Interaction Complexity: The current polynomial feature generation might not be capturing the complexity of interactions adequately. Explore higher-degree interactions for the most important features or use feature learning techniques like autoencoders.\\n\\nEnhanced Feature Scaling: If features are on very different scales, especially after creating new ones, ensure robust scaling methods are used. Features with larger scales may dominate the model, so consider normalization or standardization techniques.\\n\\nModel Ensembling: Since different models capture various aspects of the data, combining the predictions of multiple models (e.g., stacking, blending) might yield better performance than any single model.\\n\\nHuman-in-the-loop: Sometimes, domain experts can provide insights that are not immediately obvious from the data. Consultation with real estate experts could reveal factors influencing house prices that have not been encoded in the data.\\n\\nFeature Engineering Based on Errors: Create new features based on the residuals of the current model. For instance, if certain types of properties are consistently under or overestimated, a feature capturing this tendency could help the model self-correct.\\n\\nIncorporating these insights requires a careful balance to avoid overfitting while trying to capture the underlying patterns in the data more effectively. Continuous validation on a hold-out set or through cross-validation is essential to ensure genuine improvements in model performance.\\nStep 22:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1.

I think I already have the research problem in research_problem.txt. I finished getting the description statistics, and I wrote a plan to get handle missing values in train.csv. I executed the script handle_missing_values.py and now have a train_cleaned.csv that looks like it\\'s got values in it. I wrote a plan to encode categorical variables. I wrote a script for categorical encoding, and it successfully outputted a train_encoded.csv file. I created a plan for regression model training. I executed the regression model training and got a MAE of 17700.351130136984. Then, I analyzed feature importance, and completed feature engineering and produced a train_engineered.csv file. Then, I created a plan for hyperparameter tuning. I then executed the hyperparameter tuning plan and got the following output: Best Hyperparameters: {\\'n_estimators\\': 500, \\'min_samples_split\\': 2, \\'min_samples_leaf\\': 1, \\'max_features\\': \\'sqrt\\', \\'max_depth\\': 20}\\nMean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17274.369739142738. Then, I created a plan for potentially improving the current model\\'s performance. Then, I implemented advanced feature engineering by adding interaction terms and polynomial features, creating new features in the dataset and retraining the model to evaluate if the MAE is reduced below 11,000. This was the MAE: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16976.402743429742.

I just finished ensuring prepreprocessing steps applied to training data are also correctly applied to the test data. There is now a test_preprocessed.csv. I tried to write a test_predict.py script but then I realized I didn\\'t have a model saved as model.pkl so I don\\'t know what model to use, and I also didn\\'t have a model with a MAE of less than 11,000 so it wasn\\'t clear which model to use too. I wrote a plan for exploring ensemble methods such as stacking in stacking_gb_xgboost_plan.txt. I executed the stacking ensemble method, but got the following ouput: Stacked Model MAE on Validation Set: 17393.148801933337. Failure: The stacked model\\'s MAE is not below 11,000. I tried to experiment with different feature selection methods and wrote feature_selection.py with the code below, but got a MAE of 17837 which is still higher than 11,000. I experimented with L1-based feature selection to identify a more predictive subset and features and got Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set with L1-Selected Features: 32244.060640592466. I then used the advanced_feature_engineer.py model because that has the lowest MAE and I added code to save the model as a pkl file and executed the code. Then, I used that model for the analyze_errors.py script. I produced visualizations to analyze the error distribution and tried to idetnfiy specific patterns and their correlation to error. There\\'s a analyze_errors_summary.txt file was created and summarizes an analysis of the errors and types of properties where the model\\'s predictions are less accurate.\\n\\nHere is the analyze_errors_summary.txt file:\\nBased on the visualizations you\\'ve provided, here\\'s a summary and analysis:\\n\\n1. **Distribution of Prediction Errors**:\\n   - The histogram of prediction errors shows a bell-shaped distribution, which suggests that most predictions are close to the actual values, with fewer occurrences of large errors.\\n   - However, there is a noticeable skew in the distribution, indicating that there are more underestimations (negative error values) than overestimations (positive error values).\\n   - The presence of errors with large magnitudes suggests potential outliers or instances where the model significantly mispredicts.\\n\\n2. **Error vs. GrLivArea**:\\n   - The scatter plot relating prediction errors to `GrLivArea` (above-ground living area square feet) shows a pattern where larger errors are more common in properties with larger living areas.\\n   - There doesn\\'t appear to be a consistent trend or bias across the range of `GrLivArea`, but it\\'s evident that the prediction error variability increases with the size of the living area.\\n\\n3. **Error vs. OverallQual**:\\n   - The plot against `OverallQual` (rates the overall material and finish of the house) indicates that houses with higher quality ratings tend to have larger positive prediction errors, meaning the model underestimates their prices.\\n   - There\\'s a noticeable concentration of errors around the middle quality ratings (5-7), suggesting that the model may be more accurate for average-quality homes compared to high-quality ones.\\n\\n4. **Error vs. TotalBsmtSF**:\\n   - The relationship between prediction errors and `TotalBsmtSF` (total square feet of basement area) does not show a clear pattern.\\n   - However, similar to `GrLivArea`, there is an indication that larger basement areas could be associated with larger errors, though the data is quite scattered.\\n\\n**Conclusion for Task Completion**:\\n\\nThe model seems to perform relatively well for properties with average-quality ratings and smaller living areas. However, it tends to underestimate the prices for higher-quality houses and shows increasing variability in prediction errors as the living area and basement size increase. These areas could be where the model is underperforming and may benefit from further investigation or model adjustments, such as feature engineering specific to high-quality houses or handling outliers in larger homes. To improve the model, additional features that capture the nuances of higher-end properties or further tuning of the model to reduce variance in larger homes could be helpful.\\n\\nHere is the code for analyze_errors.py:\\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\nimport joblib\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport seaborn as sns\\n\\n# Load the dataset\\ndf = pd.read_csv(\\'train_encoded.csv\\')\\n\\n# Assume \\'SalePrice\\' is the target variable\\ntarget = \\'SalePrice\\'\\n\\n# Separate features and target\\nX = df.drop(target, axis=1)\\ny = df[target]\\n\\n# Apply the same Polynomial Features transformation as used during training\\npoly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, include_bias=False, interaction_only=True)\\nX_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)\\n# Use the feature names generated by polynomial transformation\\nfeature_names = poly.get_feature_names_out(X.columns)\\nX_poly = pd.DataFrame(X_poly, columns=feature_names)\\n\\n# Impute missing values (if necessary, as was done during model training)\\nimputer = SimpleImputer(strategy=\\'mean\\')\\nX_poly_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X_poly)\\n\\n# Split the dataset into training and validation sets\\nX_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X_poly_imputed, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\\n\\n# Load the pre-trained model\\ngb_model = joblib.load(\\'advanced_feature_engineering_random_forest_model.pkl\\')\\n\\n# Predict on the validation set\\npredictions = gb_model.predict(X_valid)\\n\\n# Calculate errors\\nerrors = y_valid - predictions\\n\\n# Analyze error distribution\\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\\nsns.histplot(errors, bins=30, kde=True)\\nplt.title(\\'Distribution of Prediction Errors\\')\\nplt.xlabel(\\'Error (Actual - Predicted)\\')\\nplt.ylabel(\\'Frequency\\')\\nplt.savefig(f\\'analyze_errors-distribution.png\\')\\n\\n# Correlate errors with features\\n# Use the correct columns for df_valid\\ndf_valid = pd.DataFrame(X_valid, columns=feature_names)\\ndf_valid[\\'ActualPrice\\'] = y_valid\\ndf_valid[\\'PredictedPrice\\'] = predictions\\ndf_valid[\\'Error\\'] = errors\\n\\n# Identify specific patterns (e.g., by property type, size, location, etc.)\\n# Make sure these features exist in your transformed dataset\\nfor feature in [\\'OverallQual\\', \\'GrLivArea\\', \\'TotalBsmtSF\\']:  # Replace with actual transformed feature names\\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\\n    sns.scatterplot(x=df_valid[feature], y=df_valid[\\'Error\\'])\\n    plt.title(f\\'Error vs. {feature}\\')\\n    plt.xlabel(feature)\\n    plt.ylabel(\\'Prediction Error\\')\\n    plt.savefig(f\\'analyze_errors-{feature}.png\\')\\n\\n\\nStep 19:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1.

Key areas for improvement include exploring different feature selection methods, such as univariate selection or recursive feature elimination, and reconsidering the threshold used in SelectFromModel for a more optimal feature subset. Additionally, the Gradient Boosting model may require re-tuning of hyperparameters post-feature selection to better suit the reduced feature set. Experimenting with different models, including revisiting stacking ensembles with varied base models or meta-learners, could also potentially enhance performance. The balance between feature reduction and retaining informative predictors is crucial and requires careful evaluation.\\nStep 17:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1.

I just finished ensuring prepreprocessing steps applied to training data are also correctly applied to the test data. There is now a test_preprocessed.csv. I tried to write a test_predict.py script but then I realized I didn\\'t have a model saved as model.pkl so I don\\'t know what model to use, and I also didn\\'t have a model with a MAE of less than 11,000 so it wasn\\'t clear which model to use too. I wrote a plan for exploring ensemble methods such as stacking in stacking_gb_xgboost_plan.txt.\\n\\nHere is the plan and contents of that file.\\nBased on your existing Gradient Boosting and XGBoost models, implementing a stacking ensemble method can be an effective way to leverage the strengths of both models. Here\\'s a plan for creating a stacking ensemble:\\n\\nPlan for Stacking Ensemble Method\\nBase Models:\\n\\nUse your existing Gradient Boosting and XGBoost models as the base models. These models have already been trained and evaluated on your data.\\nStacking Method:\\n\\nEmploy a stacking ensemble technique where the base models\\' predictions are used as inputs for a final model, often referred to as a meta-learner.\\nThe meta-learner can be a simpler model, such as a linear regression, which learns how to best combine the predictions from the base models.\\nTraining Process:\\n\\nSplit your dataset into two parts: one for training the base models and another for training the meta-learner.\\nTrain the base models (Gradient Boosting and XGBoost) on the first part of the dataset.\\nUse these models to make predictions on the second part of the dataset. These predictions will form a new dataset, which will be used to train the meta-learner.\\nMeta-Learner Selection:\\n\\nThe choice of meta-learner is crucial. A common choice is a linear regression model, as it\\'s straightforward and often effective in learning the optimal combination of the base modelsâ€™ predictions.\\nAlternatively, you could use a more complex model as the meta-learner if it\\'s justified by improved performance.\\nEvaluation:\\n\\nEvaluate the performance of the stacked model using the same metric (Mean Absolute Error) on a validation set.\\nCompare the performance of the stacked model with the individual base models to ensure that it provides an improvement.\\nImplementation:\\n\\nYou can use the StackingRegressor from scikit-learn to simplify the implementation. This class allows you to define a list of estimators (your base models) and a final estimator (your meta-learner).\\nExample Implementation\\nHereâ€™s a skeleton code for implementing the stacking ensemble:\\n\\npython\\nCopy code\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import StackingRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor\\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\n\\n# Base models\\ngb_model = GradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=42)\\nxgb_model = xgb.XGBRegressor(random_state=42)\\n\\n# Stacking ensemble\\nstacked_model = StackingRegressor(\\n    estimators=[(\\'gradient_boosting\\', gb_model), (\\'xgboost\\', xgb_model)],\\n    final_estimator=LinearRegression()\\n)\\n\\n# Training the stacked model\\nstacked_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\\n\\n# Predictions and evaluation\\nstacked_predictions = stacked_model.predict(X_valid)\\nstacked_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_valid, stacked_predictions)\\nprint(f\"Stacked Model MAE on Validation Set: {stacked_mae}\")\\nFinal Notes\\nThe success of this method depends on how complementary the base models are. If they capture different aspects of the data, stacking can be very effective.\\nFine-tuning the meta-learner and experimenting with different types of meta-learners can further enhance performance.\\nEnsure that the data used to train the meta-learner is not used in training the base models to prevent data leakage.\\nStep 17:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1. Use the trained model to predict SalePrice for the test_preprocessed.csv. 2. Ensure predictions are in the correct format for submission. 3. Create a submission.csv file with the required header and format. 4. Validate the submission file against the expected format.\\n\\nI finished reading data_description.txt.

Here is a list of potential improvements:\\n\\n1. Advanced Feature Engineering\\nFeature Interaction Expansion: Expand the current set of interaction terms. Experiment with different degrees in PolynomialFeatures.\\nFeature Selection: Employ techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify and keep only the most impactful features.\\nDomain-Specific Features: If domain knowledge is available, create new features that could be relevant in predicting house prices (e.g., total area, age of the property).\\nTemporal Features: If date or time-related features are present, extract more granular features (e.g., year, month, day, seasonality).\\n2. Model Complexity Adjustment\\nIncrease Model Complexity: Since RandomForest is robust to overfitting, try increasing max_depth or n_estimators further, if computational resources allow.\\nFeature Scaling with Different Models: While RandomForest does not require feature scaling, trying models that are sensitive to feature scale (like SVR or KNN) might yield better results with scaled data.\\n3. Hyperparameter Tuning Refinement\\nRefined Grid Search: Conduct a more focused grid search around the best hyperparameters found (n_estimators: 500, max_depth: 20, etc.).\\nBayesian Optimization: Use Bayesian optimization methods for a more efficient hyperparameter search than Grid or Random search.\\n4. Ensemble Methods\\nStacking: Combine multiple different models using stacking techniques. The blend of models might capture different aspects of the data.\\nBoosting Algorithms: Try boosting algorithms like XGBoost, GradientBoostingRegressor, or LightGBM, which can often yield better performance.\\n5. Additional Data Preprocessing\\nOutlier Removal: Investigate and potentially remove outliers that could be adversely affecting model performance.\\nHandling Skewed Data: Apply transformations like log, square root, or Box-Cox to features that are highly skewed.\\n6. Cross-Validation Strategy\\nFine-Tuning Cross-Validation: Adjust the cross-validation strategy, such as trying different numbers of folds, to ensure the model is generalizing well.\\n7. Deep Learning (If Applicable)\\nNeural Networks: If the dataset is large and complex enough, experimenting with neural networks could be beneficial, although this requires significant computational resources.\\n8. Error Analysis\\nAnalyze Residuals: Dive deeper into the model\\'s residuals to understand where it\\'s making errors and if there\\'s a pattern.\\nAcceptance Criteria\\nImplementation of one or more of these strategies with the aim of improving model performance and reducing MAE below 11,000.\\nRejection Criteria\\nNot exploring new avenues or strategies that can logically contribute to an improvement in model performance.\\nNote\\nEach improvement should be tested iteratively, and the model\\'s performance should be evaluated to ensure that the changes are indeed beneficial.\\nIt\\'s important to remember that achieving an MAE below 11,000 might also depend on the inherent noise and limitations within the dataset itself.\\nStep 12:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1.

Understand Model Characteristics\\nReview Model: Understand how RandomForestRegressor works, particularly how its hyperparameters influence model performance.\\n2. Identify Key Hyperparameters\\nBased on the RandomForestRegressor, consider the following hyperparameters for tuning:\\n\\nn_estimators: Number of trees in the forest.\\nmax_features: Number of features to consider when looking for the best split.\\nmax_depth: Maximum depth of each tree.\\nmin_samples_split: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\\nmin_samples_leaf: Minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\\n3. Choose a Tuning Method\\nGrid Search: Systematically explore multiple combinations of hyperparameters. Suitable for exploring a comprehensive range of combinations but can be time-consuming.\\nRandom Search: Randomly sample hyperparameter combinations. More efficient than Grid Search, especially when dealing with a large hyperparameter space.\\n4. Define Hyperparameter Space\\nSet up a grid or range for each hyperparameter.

Implement Tuning Process\\nLoad Data: Load \\'train_engineered.csv\\'.\\nSplit Data: Separate into features and target, and then into training and validation sets.\\nTuning Execution: Utilize GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV from Scikit-learn to explore hyperparameters.\\n6. Evaluation and Selection\\nEvaluate Models: Use a consistent metric, like MAE or RMSE, to evaluate different combinations.\\nSelect Best Parameters: Choose the hyperparameter set that yields the best performance on validation data.\\n7. Post-Tuning Actions\\nTrain Final Model: Train the RandomForestRegressor with the best-found hyperparameters.\\nFinal Evaluation: Evaluate the model on a validation set and compare it with the previous model\\'s performance.\\n8. Documentation\\nRecord Findings: Document the hyperparameter tuning process, findings, and final choice of hyperparameters.\\nAcceptance Criteria\\nA systematic approach to selecting and tuning hyperparameters based on logical reasoning and model performance considerations.\\nRejection Criteria\\nArbitrary selection of hyperparameters without rationale or ignoring the insights gained from feature importance and model performance.\\nAdditional Considerations\\nComputational Resources: Be mindful of the computational intensity, especially with Grid Search.\\nModel Complexity: Avoid overfitting.

Here\\'s a structured approach:\\n\\n1. Data Preparation\\nLoad Dataset: Utilize Pandas to load \\'train_encoded.csv\\'.\\nFeature-Target Split: Separate the features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable).\\nHandle Missing Values: Employ SimpleImputer from sklearn.impute to impute any missing values in the dataset.\\nData Splitting: Split the data into training and validation sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.\\n2. Model Selection\\nChoose a Regression Model: Select an appropriate regression model. For a start, a RandomForestRegressor can be used for its robustness and ability to handle non-linear relationships.\\nImport Model: Import the chosen model from Scikit-learn.\\n3. Model Training\\nInstantiate the Model: Create an instance of the selected regression model with default or tuned hyperparameters.\\nTrain the Model: Fit the model to the training data.\\n4. Model Evaluation\\nPredict on Validation Set: Use the trained model to make predictions on the validation set.\\nCalculate MAE: Utilize mean_absolute_error from sklearn.metrics to calculate the MAE between the predicted and actual values on the validation set. This metric provides an average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual values, giving a clear measure of model performance.\\n5. Results Interpretation and Iteration\\nInterpret MAE: Assess the MAE value in the context of the target variable\\'s scale and distribution.\\nModel Tuning: If necessary, return to model training, adjust hyperparameters, or try different models to improve performance.\\n6. Documentation and Reporting\\nDocument the Process: Keep a record of the model training and evaluation process, including any challenges and how they were addressed.\\nReport Findings: Summarize the modelâ€™s performance and any insights or recommendations based on the results.\\nAcceptance Criteria\\nA trained regression model using data from \\'train_encoded.csv\\'.\\nSuccessful evaluation of the model\\'s performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), with no missing value-related errors.\\nRejection Criteria\\nInadequate detail in the model selection, training process, or evaluation metrics.\\nPersistence of missing values leading to errors during model training or evaluation.\\nAdditional Notes\\nFeature Scaling: Depending on the model selected, feature scaling might be necessary.\\nHyperparameter Tuning: Consider using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search for hyperparameter optimization if the initial model performance is not satisfactory.\\nThis plan provides a comprehensive approach to training and evaluating a regression model, ensuring that the process is systematic, and the results are reliable and interpretable.\\nStep 6:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1.

I executed the script handle_missing_values.py and now have a train_cleaned.csv that looks like it\\'s got values in it. I wrote a plan to encode categorical variables.\\n\\nThis is the categorical encoding plan:\\nTo encode categorical variables in \\'train_cleaned.csv\\', a detailed and systematic approach is necessary. The plan should consider the nature of each categorical variable and choose an appropriate encoding method that best suits the variable\\'s characteristics and the requirements of subsequent machine learning models. Here\\'s a structured plan:\\n\\n1. Identification of Categorical Variables\\nRead Dataset: Load \\'train_cleaned.csv\\' using Pandas.\\nVariable Classification: Identify categorical variables. Typically, these are represented as object types in Pandas.\\n2. Analysis of Categorical Variables\\nCardinality Assessment: Determine the number of unique values (cardinality) in each categorical variable.\\nRelevance Check: Evaluate the significance of each categorical variable in the context of the analysis or predictive modeling.\\n3. Encoding Strategies\\na. One-Hot Encoding\\nApplicability: Suitable for nominal variables with low cardinality.\\nMethod: Create a new binary column for each category.\\nJustification: Preserves the distinct values without assuming any order, which is ideal for nominal data.\\nb. Label Encoding\\nApplicability: Suitable for ordinal variables where the order is important.\\nMethod: Assign a unique integer to each category based on the order.\\nJustification: Useful for maintaining the inherent order of ordinal data, but should be used cautiously as it may introduce a false sense of magnitude.\\nc. Frequency or Count Encoding\\nApplicability: Useful for high cardinality nominal variables.\\nMethod: Replace categories with their respective counts or frequency of occurrence.\\nJustification: Reduces the complexity of the data, especially useful for variables with many categories.\\nd. Target Encoding\\nApplicability: Nominal or ordinal variables in supervised learning tasks.\\nMethod: Replace categories with the mean of the target variable for each category.\\nJustification: Can capture valuable information for prediction but must be used carefully to avoid data leakage and overfitting.\\n4. Implementation\\nEncoding Execution: Apply the chosen encoding methods to the identified variables using Pandas and Scikit-learn (or category_encoders for advanced methods like target encoding).\\nHandling of Unknown Categories: Implement a strategy for dealing with categories that appear in the test set but not in the training set (if applicable).\\n5. Post-Encoding Validation\\nConsistency Check: Ensure all categorical variables are transformed, and no original categorical variables remain.\\nData Integrity: Confirm that the encoded data maintains the integrity of the original data.\\n6. Output\\nSave Transformed Dataset: Write the transformed dataset to a new CSV file, such as \\'train_encoded.csv\\'.\\nDocument the Process: Create a summary report detailing the transformations made, including the rationale behind the choice of encoding methods.\\nAcceptance Criteria\\nA new dataset where all categorical variables are appropriately encoded into numerical formats.\\nThe encoding methods are chosen and justified based on the nature of each categorical variable.\\nRejection Criteria\\nThe presence of unencoded categorical variables or inappropriate application of encoding methods.\\nNotes\\nBalance Between Information Preservation and Model Requirements: The choice of encoding should balance the need to preserve information in the categorical variables with the requirements and constraints of the machine learning models to be used.\\nAvoiding Dummy Variable Trap: When using one-hot encoding, consider dropping one binary column for each original categorical variable to avoid multicollinearity.\\nStep 4: \\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1.

Initial Data Assessment\\nLoad the Data: Utilize Pandas to load \\'train.csv\\' into a DataFrame.\\nIdentify Missing Values: Use df.isnull().sum() to get a count of missing values in each column.\\nEvaluate Missingness: Determine the pattern of missingness (MCAR - Missing Completely At Random, MAR - Missing At Random, or MNAR - Missing Not At Random).\\n2. Analyzing the Nature of Missing Data\\nCategorical vs. Numerical Data: Differentiate between categorical and numerical columns, as they require different handling strategies.\\nPercentage of Missingness: Calculate the percentage of missing data for each column (missing_count / total_rows * 100).\\n3. Handling Strategies\\na. Removal\\nDrop Columns: For columns with a high percentage of missing values (e.g., >60%), consider dropping them, especially if they are not significant for analysis or prediction.\\nDrop Rows: For rows with missing values, consider removal if the dataset is large and the number of such rows is relatively small.\\nb. Imputation for Numerical Data\\nMean/Median Imputation: For columns with a low percentage of missingness (e.g., <5%), impute using the mean (for normally distributed data) or median (for skewed data).\\nRegression Imputation: If a numerical column is highly correlated with another numerical column, use regression to predict missing values.\\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation: Use KNN imputation for more complex scenarios where multiple attributes determine the missing value.\\nc. Imputation for Categorical Data\\nMode Imputation: For columns with a low percentage of missingness, impute using the mode (most frequent category).\\nPredictive Modeling: In cases of significant missingness, consider using classification algorithms to predict missing categories based on other features.\\n4. Handling Special Cases\\nFlagging: For columns where missingness is informative (MNAR), create a new binary column indicating the presence or absence of data.\\nTime-Series Data: If \\'train.csv\\' contains time-series data, use time-based imputation methods, like forward fill or backward fill.\\n5. Validation and Analysis Post-Imputation\\nData Distribution Analysis: After imputation, analyze the distribution of data to ensure that the imputation hasn\\'t significantly altered it.\\nModel Performance Comparison: Compare model performance using data before and after imputation to assess the impact.\\n6. Documentation\\nRecord Keeping: Document each action taken for reproducibility and future reference.\\n7.

      "I finished reading data_description.txt. I think I already have the research problem in research_problem.txt. I finished getting the description statistics, and I wrote a plan to get handle missing values in train.csv. I executed the script handle_missing_values.py and now have a train_cleaned.csv that looks like it's got values in it. I wrote a plan to encode categorical variables. I wrote a script for categorical encoding, and it successfully outputted a train_encoded.csv file. I created a plan for regression model training. I executed the regression model training and got a MAE of 17700.351130136984. Then, I analyzed feature importance, and completed feature engineering and produced a train_engineered.csv file. Then, I created a plan for hyperparameter tuning. I then executed the hyperparameter tuning plan and got the following output: Best Hyperparameters: {'n_estimators': 500, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'max_depth': 20}\n",
      "Mean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17274.369739142738. Then, I created a plan for potentially improving the current model's performance. Then, I implemented advanced feature engineering by adding interaction terms and polynomial features, creating new features in the dataset and retraining the model to evaluate if the MAE is reduced below 11,000. This was the MAE: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16976.402743429742. Then I implemented refined hyperparameter tuning around the best hyperparameters found, and I got the following:\n",

      "Mean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17266.691320088325. Then I tried out gradient boosting and got the following MAE: Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set: 17179.78904113612 and XGBoost and got the following MAE: XGBoost MAE on Validation Set: 17668.19214201627. I just finished ensuring prepreprocessing steps applied to training data are also correctly applied to the test data. There is now a test_preprocessed.csv. I tried to write a test_predict.py script but then I realized I didn't have a model saved as model.pkl so I don't know what model to use, and I also didn't have a model with a MAE of less than 11,000 so it wasn't clear which model to use too. I wrote a plan for exploring ensemble methods such as stacking in stacking_gb_xgboost_plan.txt. I executed the stacking ensemble method, but got the following ouput: Stacked Model MAE on Validation Set: 17393.148801933337. Failure: The stacked model's MAE is not below 11,000. I tried to experiment with different feature selection methods and wrote feature_selection.py with the code below, but got a MAE of 17837 which is still higher than 11,000. I experimented with L1-based feature selection to identify a more predictive subset and features and got Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set with L1-Selected Features: 32244.060640592466. I then used the advanced_feature_engineer.py model because that has the lowest MAE and I added code to save the model as a pkl file and executed the code. Then, I used that model for the analyze_errors.py script. I produced visualizations to analyze the error distribution and tried to idetnfiy specific patterns and their correlation to error. There's a analyze_errors_summary.txt file was created and summarizes an analysis of the errors and types of properties where the model's predictions are less accurate. I created advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16549.762519474294. I tried to refine feature engineering by writing an advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py based on error anlaysis insights. However, I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16867.688131983028. I further reflected on the error analysis for additional insights in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I then implemented outlier detection using an algorithm like Isolation Forest on GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF, and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Outlier Detection: 15505.041583375516. I then tried implementing segmentation-based modeling by creating separate models for different segments of the data, specifically targetting high-quality houses and properties with alrger living areas and basements. I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error for HighQualityLargeProperties: 51059.29307922336. Model for HighQualityLargeProperties rejected due to high MAE. I reflected on the error analysis insights and put my reflections in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I implemented skewness correction in skewness_correction.py by applying a log transformation to the SalePrice target variable. I retrained the outlier detection model because that was the best model so far using the log transformed target variable and got a MAE of 16478. I then tried to apply robust scaling to features with potential outliers or heavy tails, but I got Mean Absolute Error after Robust Scaling: 17111.915956794848. I reviewed the error analysis again and identified at least one actionable insight to potentially reduce the MAE. I then wrote a 'targeted_feature_engineering.py' to implement new features focusing on high-value and large properties and got Mean Absolute Error after Targeted Feature Engineering: 13978.312204170952. I then tried to refine the targeted feature engineering in the targeted_feature_engineering.py script by adjusting the thresholds for defining high-quality and large properties and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Adjusted Targeted Feature Engineering: 16477.\n",

I then executed the hyperparameter tuning plan and got the following output: Best Hyperparameters: {'n_estimators': 500, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'max_depth': 20}\n",
      "Mean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17274.369739142738. Then, I created a plan for potentially improving the current model's performance. Then, I implemented advanced feature engineering by adding interaction terms and polynomial features, creating new features in the dataset and retraining the model to evaluate if the MAE is reduced below 11,000. This was the MAE: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16976.402743429742. Then I implemented refined hyperparameter tuning around the best hyperparameters found, and I got the following:\n",
      "Refined Best Hyperparameters: {'max_depth': 15, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 550}\n",
      "Mean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17266.691320088325. Then I tried out gradient boosting and got the following MAE: Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set: 17179.78904113612 and XGBoost and got the following MAE: XGBoost MAE on Validation Set: 17668.19214201627. I just finished ensuring prepreprocessing steps applied to training data are also correctly applied to the test data. There is now a test_preprocessed.csv. I tried to write a test_predict.py script but then I realized I didn't have a model saved as model.pkl so I don't know what model to use, and I also didn't have a model with a MAE of less than 11,000 so it wasn't clear which model to use too. I wrote a plan for exploring ensemble methods such as stacking in stacking_gb_xgboost_plan.txt. I executed the stacking ensemble method, but got the following ouput: Stacked Model MAE on Validation Set: 17393.148801933337. Failure: The stacked model's MAE is not below 11,000. I tried to experiment with different feature selection methods and wrote feature_selection.py with the code below, but got a MAE of 17837 which is still higher than 11,000. I experimented with L1-based feature selection to identify a more predictive subset and features and got Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set with L1-Selected Features: 32244.060640592466. I then used the advanced_feature_engineer.py model because that has the lowest MAE and I added code to save the model as a pkl file and executed the code. Then, I used that model for the analyze_errors.py script. I produced visualizations to analyze the error distribution and tried to idetnfiy specific patterns and their correlation to error. There's a analyze_errors_summary.txt file was created and summarizes an analysis of the errors and types of properties where the model's predictions are less accurate. I created advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16549.762519474294. I tried to refine feature engineering by writing an advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py based on error anlaysis insights. However, I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16867.688131983028. I further reflected on the error analysis for additional insights in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I then implemented outlier detection using an algorithm like Isolation Forest on GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF, and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Outlier Detection: 15505.041583375516. I then tried implementing segmentation-based modeling by creating separate models for different segments of the data, specifically targetting high-quality houses and properties with alrger living areas and basements. I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error for HighQualityLargeProperties: 51059.29307922336. Model for HighQualityLargeProperties rejected due to high MAE. I reflected on the error analysis insights and put my reflections in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I implemented skewness correction in skewness_correction.py by applying a log transformation to the SalePrice target variable. I retrained the outlier detection model because that was the best model so far using the log transformed target variable and got a MAE of 16478. I then tried to apply robust scaling to features with potential outliers or heavy tails, but I got Mean Absolute Error after Robust Scaling: 17111.915956794848. I reviewed the error analysis again and identified at least one actionable insight to potentially reduce the MAE. I then wrote a 'targeted_feature_engineering.py' to implement new features focusing on high-value and large properties and got Mean Absolute Error after Targeted Feature Engineering: 13978.312204170952. I then tried to refine the targeted feature engineering in the targeted_feature_engineering.py script by adjusting the thresholds for defining high-quality and large properties and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Adjusted Targeted Feature Engineering: 16477.\n",

<list_reverseiterator object at 0x0000024139203040>\\nMost recent a) attempted tasks, b) plans, c) results, d) answer states (newest to oldest):\\n\\nStep 29:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: The plan should include refining the targeted feature engineering approach, retraining the model, evaluating the MAE, and if successful, preparing the submission.csv file.\\n\\nI finished reading data_description.txt. I think I already have the research problem in research_problem.txt. I finished getting the description statistics, and I wrote a plan to get handle missing values in train.csv. I executed the script handle_missing_values.py and now have a train_cleaned.csv that looks like it\\'s got values in it. I wrote a plan to encode categorical variables. I wrote a script for categorical encoding, and it successfully outputted a train_encoded.csv file. I created a plan for regression model training. I executed the regression model training and got a MAE of 17700.351130136984. Then, I analyzed feature importance, and completed feature engineering and produced a train_engineered.csv file. Then, I created a plan for hyperparameter tuning. I then executed the hyperparameter tuning plan and got the following output: Best Hyperparameters: {\\'n_estimators\\': 500, \\'min_samples_split\\': 2, \\'min_samples_leaf\\': 1, \\'max_features\\': \\'sqrt\\', \\'max_depth\\': 20}\\nMean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17274.369739142738. Then, I created a plan for potentially improving the current model\\'s performance. Then, I implemented advanced feature engineering by adding interaction terms and polynomial features, creating new features in the dataset and retraining the model to evaluate if the MAE is reduced below 11,000. This was the MAE: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16976.402743429742. Then I implemented refined hyperparameter tuning around the best hyperparameters found, and I got the following:\\nRefined Best Hyperparameters: {\\'max_depth\\': 15, \\'max_features\\': \\'sqrt\\', \\'min_samples_leaf\\': 1, \\'min_samples_split\\': 2, \\'n_estimators\\': 550}\\nMean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17266.691320088325. Then I tried out gradient boosting and got the following MAE: Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set: 17179.78904113612 and XGBoost and got the following MAE: XGBoost MAE on Validation Set: 17668.19214201627. I just finished ensuring prepreprocessing steps applied to training data are also correctly applied to the test data. There is now a test_preprocessed.csv. I tried to write a test_predict.py script but then I realized I didn\\'t have a model saved as model.pkl so I don\\'t know what model to use, and I also didn\\'t have a model with a MAE of less than 11,000 so it wasn\\'t clear which model to use too. I wrote a plan for exploring ensemble methods such as stacking in stacking_gb_xgboost_plan.txt. I executed the stacking ensemble method, but got the following ouput: Stacked Model MAE on Validation Set: 17393.148801933337. Failure: The stacked model\\'s MAE is not below 11,000. I tried to experiment with different feature selection methods and wrote feature_selection.py with the code below, but got a MAE of 17837 which is still higher than 11,000. I experimented with L1-based feature selection to identify a more predictive subset and features and got Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set with L1-Selected Features: 32244.060640592466. I then used the advanced_feature_engineer.py model because that has the lowest MAE and I added code to save the model as a pkl file and executed the code. Then, I used that model for the analyze_errors.py script. I produced visualizations to analyze the error distribution and tried to idetnfiy specific patterns and their correlation to error. There\\'s a analyze_errors_summary.txt file was created and summarizes an analysis of the errors and types of properties where the model\\'s predictions are less accurate. I created advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16549.762519474294. I tried to refine feature engineering by writing an advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py based on error anlaysis insights. However, I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16867.688131983028. I further reflected on the error analysis for additional insights in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I then implemented outlier detection using an algorithm like Isolation Forest on GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF, and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Outlier Detection: 15505.041583375516. I then tried implementing segmentation-based modeling by creating separate models for different segments of the data, specifically targetting high-quality houses and properties with alrger living areas and basements. I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error for HighQualityLargeProperties: 51059.29307922336. Model for HighQualityLargeProperties rejected due to high MAE. I reflected on the error analysis insights and put my reflections in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I implemented skewness correction in skewness_correction.py by applying a log transformation to the SalePrice target variable. I retrained the outlier detection model because that was the best model so far using the log transformed target variable and got a MAE of 16478. I then tried to apply robust scaling to features with potential outliers or heavy tails, but I got Mean Absolute Error after Robust Scaling: 17111.915956794848. I reviewed the error analysis again and identified at least one actionable insight to potentially reduce the MAE. I then wrote a \\'targeted_feature_engineering.py\\' to implement new features focusing on high-value and large properties and got Mean Absolute Error after Targeted Feature Engineering: 13978.312204170952. I then tried to refine the targeted feature engineering in the targeted_feature_engineering.py script by adjusting the thresholds for defining high-quality and large properties and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Adjusted Targeted Feature Engineering: 16477.\\n\\nHere is the code for targeted_feature_engineering_v2.py: \\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\\nimport joblib\\n\\n# Load the dataset\\ndf = pd.read_csv(\\'train_encoded.csv\\')\\n\\n# Assume \\'SalePrice\\' is the target variable\\ntarget = \\'SalePrice\\'\\n\\n# Separate features and target\\nX = df.drop(target, axis=1)\\ny = df[target]\\n\\n# Adjust thresholds for high-quality and large properties\\nquality_threshold = X[\\'OverallQual\\'].quantile(0.95)  # Adjusted from 0.9 to 0.85\\nsize_threshold = X[\\'GrLivArea\\'].quantile(0.95)      # Adjusted from 0.9 to 0.85\\n\\n# Create new features targeting adjusted high-quality houses and larger properties\\nX[\\'HighQuality\\'] = (X[\\'OverallQual\\'] > quality_threshold).astype(int)\\nX[\\'LargeProperty\\'] = (X[\\'GrLiv...

prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: The plan should include refining the targeted feature engineering approach, retraining the model, evaluating the MAE, and if successful, preparing the submission.csv file.\\n\\nI finished reading data_description.txt. I think I already have the research problem in research_problem.txt. I finished getting the description statistics, and I wrote a plan to get handle missing values in train.csv. I executed the script handle_missing_values.py and now have a train_cleaned.csv that looks like it\\'s got values in it. I wrote a plan to encode categorical variables. I wrote a script for categorical encoding, and it successfully outputted a train_encoded.csv file. I created a plan for regression model training. I executed the regression model training and got a MAE of 17700.351130136984. Then, I analyzed feature importance, and completed feature engineering and produced a train_engineered.csv file. Then, I created a plan for hyperparameter tuning. I then executed the hyperparameter tuning plan and got the following output: Best Hyperparameters: {\\'n_estimators\\': 500, \\'min_samples_split\\': 2, \\'min_samples_leaf\\': 1, \\'max_features\\': \\'sqrt\\', \\'max_depth\\': 20}\\nMean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17274.369739142738. Then, I created a plan for potentially improving the current model\\'s performance. Then, I implemented advanced feature engineering by adding interaction terms and polynomial features, creating new features in the dataset and retraining the model to evaluate if the MAE is reduced below 11,000. This was the MAE: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16976.402743429742. Then I implemented refined hyperparameter tuning around the best hyperparameters found, and I got the following:\\nRefined Best Hyperparameters: {\\'max_depth\\': 15, \\'max_features\\': \\'sqrt\\', \\'min_samples_leaf\\': 1, \\'min_samples_split\\': 2, \\'n_estimators\\': 550}\\nMean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17266.691320088325. Then I tried out gradient boosting and got the following MAE: Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set: 17179.78904113612 and XGBoost and got the following MAE: XGBoost MAE on Validation Set: 17668.19214201627. I just finished ensuring prepreprocessing steps applied to training data are also correctly applied to the test data. There is now a test_preprocessed.csv. I tried to write a test_predict.py script but then I realized I didn\\'t have a model saved as model.pkl so I don\\'t know what model to use, and I also didn\\'t have a model with a MAE of less than 11,000 so it wasn\\'t clear which model to use too. I wrote a plan for exploring ensemble methods such as stacking in stacking_gb_xgboost_plan.txt. I executed the stacking ensemble method, but got the following ouput: Stacked Model MAE on Validation Set: 17393.148801933337. Failure: The stacked model\\'s MAE is not below 11,000. I tried to experiment with different feature selection methods and wrote feature_selection.py with the code below, but got a MAE of 17837 which is still higher than 11,000. I experimented with L1-based feature selection to identify a more predictive subset and features and got Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set with L1-Selected Features: 32244.060640592466. I then used the advanced_feature_engineer.py model because that has the lowest MAE and I added code to save the model as a pkl file and executed the code. Then, I used that model for the analyze_errors.py script. I produced visualizations to analyze the error distribution and tried to idetnfiy specific patterns and their correlation to error. There\\'s a analyze_errors_summary.txt file was created and summarizes an analysis of the errors and types of properties where the model\\'s predictions are less accurate. I created advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16549.762519474294. I tried to refine feature engineering by writing an advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py based on error anlaysis insights. However, I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16867.688131983028. I further reflected on the error analysis for additional insights in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I then implemented outlier detection using an algorithm like Isolation Forest on GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF, and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Outlier Detection: 15505.041583375516. I then tried implementing segmentation-based modeling by creating separate models for different segments of the data, specifically targetting high-quality houses and properties with alrger living areas and basements. I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error for HighQualityLargeProperties: 51059.29307922336. Model for HighQualityLargeProperties rejected due to high MAE. I reflected on the error analysis insights and put my reflections in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I implemented skewness correction in skewness_correction.py by applying a log transformation to the SalePrice target variable. I retrained the outlier detection model because that was the best model so far using the log transformed target variable and got a MAE of 16478. I then tried to apply robust scaling to features with potential outliers or heavy tails, but I got Mean Absolute Error after Robust Scaling: 17111.915956794848. I reviewed the error analysis again and identified at least one actionable insight to potentially reduce the MAE. I then wrote a \\'targeted_feature_engineering.py\\' to implement new features focusing on high-value and large properties and got Mean Absolute Error after Targeted Feature Engineering: 13978.312204170952. I then tried to refine the targeted feature engineering in the targeted_feature_engineering.py script by adjusting the thresholds for defining high-quality and large properties and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Adjusted Targeted Feature Engineering: 16477.\\n\\nHere is the code for targeted_feature_engineering_v2.py: \\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\\nimport joblib\\n\\n# Load the dataset\\ndf = pd.read_csv(\\'train_encoded.csv\\')\\n\\n# Assume \\'SalePrice\\' is the target variable\\ntarget = \\'SalePrice\\'\\n\\n# Separate features and target\\nX = df.drop(target, axis=1)\\ny = df[target]\\n\\n# Adjust thresholds for high-quality and large properties\\nquality_threshold = X[\\'OverallQual\\'].quantile(0.95)  # Adjusted from 0.9 to 0.85\\nsize_threshold = X[\\'GrLivArea\\'].quantile(0.95)      # Adjusted from 0.9 to 0.85\\n\\n# Create new features targeting adjusted high-quality houses and larger properties\\nX[\\'HighQuality\\'] = (X[\\'OverallQual\\'] > quality_threshold).astype(int)\\nX[\\'LargeProperty\\'] = (X[\\'GrLivArea\\'] > size_threshold).astype(int)\\nX[\\'Quality_Size_Interaction\\'] = X[\\'HighQuality\\'] * X[\\'LargeProperty\\']\\nX[\\'Quality_GrLivArea\\'] = X[\\'HighQuality\\'] * X[\\'GrLivArea\\']\\nX[\\'Quality_TotalBsmtSF\\'] = X[\\'HighQuality\\'] * X[\\'TotalBsmtSF\\']\\n\\n# Polynomial features\\npoly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, include_bias=False, interaction_only=True)\\nX_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)\\nX_poly_df = pd.DataFrame(X_poly, columns=poly.get_feature_names_out(X.columns))\\n\\n# Impute missing values\\nimputer = SimpleImputer(strategy=\\'mean\\')\\nX_poly_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X_poly_df)\\n\\n# Split into training and validation sets\\nX_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X_poly_imputed, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\\n\\n# Initialize the RandomForestRegressor with the best hyperparameters\\nmodel = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=500, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1, max_features=\\'sqrt\\', max_depth=20, random_state=42)\\n\\n# Train the model on the enhanced dataset\\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\\n\\n# Predict on the validation set\\npredictions = model.predict(X_valid)\\n\\n# Evaluate the model using Mean Absolute Error\\nmae = mean_absolute_error(y_valid, predictions)\\n\\nprint(f\"Mean Absolute Error after Adjusted Targeted Feature Engineering: {mae}\")\\n\\n# Save the model if MAE is improved\\nif mae < 13978.312204170952:  # Replace with previous MAE\\n    model_filename = \\'model_with_adjusted_targeted_feature_engineering.pkl\\'\\n    joblib.dump(model, model_filename)\\n    print(f\"Model saved as {model_filename}\")\\n\\n\\nStep 28:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1.

I tried to experiment with different feature selection methods and wrote feature_selection.py with the code below, but got a MAE of 17837 which is still higher than 11,000. I experimented with L1-based feature selection to identify a more predictive subset and features and got Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set with L1-Selected Features: 32244.060640592466. I then used the advanced_feature_engineer.py model because that has the lowest MAE and I added code to save the model as a pkl file and executed the code. Then, I used that model for the analyze_errors.py script. I produced visualizations to analyze the error distribution and tried to idetnfiy specific patterns and their correlation to error. There\\'s a analyze_errors_summary.txt file was created and summarizes an analysis of the errors and types of properties where the model\\'s predictions are less accurate. I created advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16549.762519474294. I tried to refine feature engineering by writing an advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py based on error anlaysis insights. However, I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16867.688131983028. I further reflected on the error analysis for additional insights in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I then implemented outlier detection using an algorithm like Isolation Forest on GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF, and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Outlier Detection: 15505.041583375516. I then tried implementing segmentation-based modeling by creating separate models for different segments of the data, specifically targetting high-quality houses and properties with alrger living areas and basements. I got the following output: Mean Absolute Error for HighQualityLargeProperties: 51059.29307922336. Model for HighQualityLargeProperties rejected due to high MAE. I reflected on the error analysis insights and put my reflections in error_analysis_reflection.txt. I implemented skewness correction in skewness_correction.py by applying a log transformation to the SalePrice target variable. I retrained the outlier detection model because that was the best model so far using the log transformed target variable and got a MAE of 16478. I then tried to apply robust scaling to features with potential outliers or heavy tails, but I got Mean Absolute Error after Robust Scaling: 17111.915956794848. I reviewed the error analysis again and identified at least one actionable insight to potentially reduce the MAE.\\n\\nError analysis review: \\nReflecting on the comprehensive history of actions taken and the detailed error analysis, a key actionable insight emerges that could potentially reduce the MAE further:\\n\\nTargeted Feature Engineering for Specific Property Types: The previous attempts have mostly focused on broad feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and different model architectures. However, given the specific insights from the error analysis:\\n\\nDifferentiated Treatment for High-Value Properties: The model tends to underestimate the prices for higher-quality houses. This suggests that high-quality or high-value properties might follow a different pricing pattern than the rest of the dataset. Therefore, creating features that specifically cater to this segment can be beneficial. For example, introducing interaction terms that combine high-quality indicators (like top-tier OverallQual) with other significant features (like GrLivArea) might help the model better capture the nuances of high-value property pricing.\\n\\nCustomized Treatment for Large Properties: Similarly, for properties with larger living areas (GrLivArea) and basements (TotalBsmtSF), the model\\'s prediction variability increases. Here, developing size-specific features or even a separate sub-model for large properties could be useful. For instance, introducing a binary feature indicating whether a property is above a certain size threshold and using it in interaction with other key features might help.\\n\\nIn both cases, the focus should be on understanding and modeling the unique characteristics of these specific segments, as they appear to be the main source of larger prediction errors. This targeted approach could be more effective than general feature engineering strategies and might bring the MAE below the desired threshold of 11,000.\\n\\nStep 27:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1. Revisit the error analysis insights to identify potential improvements in feature engineering or model adjustments. 2. Implement these improvements and retrain the model. 3. Evaluate the model to check if the MAE is below 11,000. 4. If the MAE is below 11,000, save the model and predict on test_preprocessed.csv. 5. Prepare the submission.csv file ensuring it meets the competition\\'s format requirements.\\n\\nI finished reading data_description.txt. I think I already have the research problem in research_problem.txt. I finished getting the description statistics, and I wrote a plan to get handle missing values in train.csv. I executed the script handle_missing_values.py and now have a train_cleaned.csv that looks like it\\'s got values in it. I wrote a plan to encode categorical variables. I wrote a script for categorical encoding, and it successfully outputted a train_encoded.csv file. I created a plan for regression model training. I executed the regression model training and got a MAE of 17700.351130136984. Then, I analyzed feature importance, and completed feature engineering and produced a train_engineered.csv file. Then, I created a plan for hyperparameter tuning. I then executed the hyperparameter tuning plan and got the following output: Best Hyperparameters: {\\'n_estimators\\': 500, \\'min_samples_split\\': 2, \\'min_samples_leaf\\': 1, \\'max_features\\': \\'sqrt\\', \\'max_depth\\': 20}\\nMean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17274.369739142738. Then, I created a plan for potentially improving the current model\\'s performance. Then, I implemented advanced feature engineering by adding interaction terms and polynomial features, creating new features in the dataset and retraining the model to evaluate if the MAE is reduced below 11,000. This was the MAE: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16976.402743429742. Then I implemented refined hyperparameter tuning around the best hyperparameters found, and I got the following:\\nRefined Best Hyperparameters: {\\'max_depth\\': 15, \\'max_features\\': \\'sqrt\\', \\'min_samples_leaf\\': 1, \\'min_samples_split\\': 2, \\'n_estimators\\': 550}\\nMean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17266.691320088325. Then I tried out gradient boosting and got the following MAE: Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set: 17179.78904113612 and XGBoost and got the following MAE: XGBoost MAE on Validation Set: 17668.19214201627. I just finished ensuring prepreprocessing steps applied to training data are also correctly applied to the test data. There is now a test_preprocessed.csv. I tried to write a test_predict.py script but then I realized I didn\\'t have a model saved as model.pkl so I don\\'t know what model to use, and I also didn\\'t have a model with a MAE of less than 11,000 so it wasn\\'t clear which model to use too.

I reflected on the error analysis insights and put my reflections in error_analysis_reflection.txt.\\n\\nHere are the contents of error_analysis_reflection.txt:\\nReflecting on the detailed error analysis, here are potential improvements for feature engineering and model adjustments:\\n\\nSkewness Correction: The negative skew in error distribution implies the model\\'s systematic underestimation. Implement a skewness correction for target variable (e.g., log transformation of SalePrice) to better capture high-value property prices.\\n\\nGrLivArea Error Variability:\\n\\nSize Premium Feature: Add a feature that represents the \\'premium\\' for larger properties, which could be an interaction term between GrLivArea and a binary feature indicating if the property is above a certain size threshold.\\nNon-linear Transformation: Apply non-linear transformations to GrLivArea (e.g., square root or logarithm) to potentially reduce the impact of extreme values.\\nOverallQual Underestimation:\\n\\nQuality-Size Interaction: Since higher quality ratings lead to underestimation, consider an interaction feature between OverallQual and GrLivArea or TotalBsmtSF to capture the combined effect of quality and size on price.\\nHigh-Quality Flag: Introduce a binary feature that flags the top-tier quality houses (e.g., OverallQual in the top 10%).\\nTotalBsmtSF Error Pattern:\\n\\nBasement Finish Quality: If not already included, add a feature representing the finish quality or condition of the basement, which can affect property value significantly.\\nBasement Size Binning: Use binning or categorization to create discrete basement size groups, which could help the model differentiate between typical and atypically large basements.\\nError Residual Features: Create new features based on the residuals of the current model predictions. For instance, a feature that captures the magnitude and direction of past errors for similar properties.\\n\\nOutlier Adjustment: Rather than removing outliers, implement a method to adjust the outlier target values closer to the prediction boundary, which could be a soft capping or a Winsorizing technique.\\n\\nSegmented Model Refinement: For segmented models, ensure that the feature set is optimized for each segment. Different segments may have different predictors that are important.\\n\\nModel Complexity for High-End Houses: High-end properties may have more complex features influencing their prices. For such segments, consider more complex models or increase the depth and number of estimators in the RandomForestRegressor.\\n\\nCross-Validation by Segments: Perform cross-validation within each segment to ensure that the model\\'s hyperparameters are tuned correctly for that specific subset of the data.\\n\\nTemporal Features for Market Trend: Add features that capture the market trend at the time of sale to account for economic factors affecting house prices.\\n\\nThese insights are aimed at reducing systematic errors and improving the model\\'s prediction across different segments of the housing market, particularly for high-quality and larger properties. Implementing these changes requires careful consideration to prevent overfitting while addressing the specific error patterns identified.\\n\\nStep 24:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1. Implement segmentation-based modeling by dividing the dataset into meaningful segments (e.g., high-quality homes, average homes, large homes). 2. Develop separate models for each segment. 3. Evaluate each model to check if the MAE is below 11,000. 4. If the MAE is below 11,000 for all segments, combine the segment-specific models for final predictions. 5.

You could use methods like Isolation Forest or DBSCAN to detect outliers in features such as GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF.\\n\\nSegmentation-Based Modeling: Given that the model\\'s performance varies by quality and size, consider segmenting the dataset into groups (e.g., high-quality homes, average homes, large homes) and developing separate models for each segment. This approach can tailor the model to specific data distributions and may improve overall accuracy.\\n\\nError Correlation Analysis: Conduct a deeper analysis to see if errors correlate with other features that haven\\'t been considered yet. For example, the age of the property, its location, or proximity to amenities could play a significant role and provide insight into additional features.\\n\\nAdvanced Non-linear Features: The analysis suggests that the relationship between features like OverallQual and GrLivArea with the target variable may be non-linear. Investigating more complex non-linear transformations or kernel methods might capture these relationships better.\\n\\nTemporal Dynamics: If the dataset spans a significant time period, consider the impact of market trends over time. Features capturing the temporal aspect, like \\'year sold\\' or \\'month sold\\', could help account for inflation or housing market fluctuations.\\n\\nFeature Interaction Complexity: The current polynomial feature generation might not be capturing the complexity of interactions adequately. Explore higher-degree interactions for the most important features or use feature learning techniques like autoencoders.\\n\\nEnhanced Feature Scaling: If features are on very different scales, especially after creating new ones, ensure robust scaling methods are used. Features with larger scales may dominate the model, so consider normalization or standardization techniques.\\n\\nModel Ensembling: Since different models capture various aspects of the data, combining the predictions of multiple models (e.g., stacking, blending) might yield better performance than any single model.\\n\\nHuman-in-the-loop: Sometimes, domain experts can provide insights that are not immediately obvious from the data. Consultation with real estate experts could reveal factors influencing house prices that have not been encoded in the data.\\n\\nFeature Engineering Based on Errors: Create new features based on the residuals of the current model. For instance, if certain types of properties are consistently under or overestimated, a feature capturing this tendency could help the model self-correct.\\n\\nIncorporating these insights requires a careful balance to avoid overfitting while trying to capture the underlying patterns in the data more effectively. Continuous validation on a hold-out set or through cross-validation is essential to ensure genuine improvements in model performance.\\nStep 22:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1. Use insights from the error analysis to refine feature engineering, focusing on high-quality houses and properties with larger living areas and basements. 2. Re-train the model with the refined features and check if the MAE is reduced below 11,000. 3. If the MAE is still above 11,000, consider additional model adjustments or alternative algorithms. 4. Once the MAE is below 11,000, save the model and predict on test_preprocessed.csv. 5. Prepare the submission.csv file ensuring it meets the competition\\'s format requirements.\\n\\nI finished reading data_description.txt. I think I already have the research problem in research_problem.txt. I finished getting the description statistics, and I wrote a plan to get handle missing values in train.csv. I executed the script handle_missing_values.py and now have a train_cleaned.csv that looks like it\\'s got values in it. I wrote a plan to encode categorical variables. I wrote a script for categorical encoding, and it successfully outputted a train_encoded.csv file. I created a plan for regression model training. I executed the regression model training and got a MAE of 17700.351130136984. Then, I analyzed feature importance, and completed feature engineering and produced a train_engineered.csv file. Then, I created a plan for hyperparameter tuning. I then executed the hyperparameter tuning plan and got the following output: Best Hyperparameters: {\\'n_estimators\\': 500, \\'min_samples_split\\': 2, \\'min_samples_leaf\\': 1, \\'max_features\\': \\'sqrt\\', \\'max_depth\\': 20}\\nMean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17274.369739142738. Then, I created a plan for potentially improving the current model\\'s performance. Then, I implemented advanced feature engineering by adding interaction terms and polynomial features, creating new features in the dataset and retraining the model to evaluate if the MAE is reduced below 11,000. This was the MAE: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16976.402743429742. Then I implemented refined hyperparameter tuning around the best hyperparameters found, and I got the following:\\nRefined Best Hyperparameters: {\\'max_depth\\': 15, \\'max_features\\': \\'sqrt\\', \\'min_samples_leaf\\': 1, \\'min_samples_split\\': 2, \\'n_estimators\\': 550}\\nMean Absolute Error on Validation Set: 17266.691320088325.

I wrote a plan for exploring ensemble methods such as stacking in stacking_gb_xgboost_plan.txt. I executed the stacking ensemble method, but got the following ouput: Stacked Model MAE on Validation Set: 17393.148801933337. Failure: The stacked model\\'s MAE is not below 11,000. I tried to experiment with different feature selection methods and wrote feature_selection.py with the code below, but got a MAE of 17837 which is still higher than 11,000. I experimented with L1-based feature selection to identify a more predictive subset and features and got Gradient Boosting MAE on Validation Set with L1-Selected Features: 32244.060640592466. I then used the advanced_feature_engineer.py model because that has the lowest MAE and I added code to save the model as a pkl file and executed the code. Then, I used that model for the analyze_errors.py script. I produced visualizations to analyze the error distribution and tried to idetnfiy specific patterns and their correlation to error. There\\'s a analyze_errors_summary.txt file was created and summarizes an analysis of the errors and types of properties where the model\\'s predictions are less accurate. I created advanced_feature_engineering_new_features.py and got the following output: Mean Absolute Error after Feature Engineering: 16549.762519474294.

However, it tends to underestimate the prices for higher-quality houses and shows increasing variability in prediction errors as the living area and basement size increase. These areas could be where the model is underperforming and may benefit from further investigation or model adjustments, such as feature engineering specific to high-quality houses or handling outliers in larger homes. To improve the model, additional features that capture the nuances of higher-end properties or further tuning of the model to reduce variance in larger homes could be helpful.\\n\\nHere is the code for analyze_errors.py:\\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\nimport joblib\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport seaborn as sns\\n\\n# Load the dataset\\ndf = pd.read_csv(\\'train_encoded.csv\\')\\n\\n# Assume \\'SalePrice\\' is the target variable\\ntarget = \\'SalePrice\\'\\n\\n# Separate features and target\\nX = df.drop(target, axis=1)\\ny = df[target]\\n\\n# Apply the same Polynomial Features transformation as used during training\\npoly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, include_bias=False, interaction_only=True)\\nX_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)\\n# Use the feature names generated by polynomial transformation\\nfeature_names = poly.get_feature_names_out(X.columns)\\nX_poly = pd.DataFrame(X_poly, columns=feature_names)\\n\\n# Impute missing values (if necessary, as was done during model training)\\nimputer = SimpleImputer(strategy=\\'mean\\')\\nX_poly_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X_poly)\\n\\n# Split the dataset into training and validation sets\\nX_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X_poly_imputed, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\\n\\n# Load the pre-trained model\\ngb_model = joblib.load(\\'advanced_feature_engineering_random_forest_model.pkl\\')\\n\\n# Predict on the validation set\\npredictions = gb_model.predict(X_valid)\\n\\n# Calculate errors\\nerrors = y_valid - predictions\\n\\n# Analyze error distribution\\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\\nsns.histplot(errors, bins=30, kde=True)\\nplt.title(\\'Distribution of Prediction Errors\\')\\nplt.xlabel(\\'Error (Actual - Predicted)\\')\\nplt.ylabel(\\'Frequency\\')\\nplt.savefig(f\\'analyze_errors-distribution.png\\')\\n\\n# Correlate errors with features\\n# Use the correct columns for df_valid\\ndf_valid = pd.DataFrame(X_valid, columns=feature_names)\\ndf_valid[\\'ActualPrice\\'] = y_valid\\ndf_valid[\\'PredictedPrice\\'] = predictions\\ndf_valid[\\'Error\\'] = errors\\n\\n# Identify specific patterns (e.g., by property type, size, location, etc.)\\n# Make sure these features exist in your transformed dataset\\nfor feature in [\\'OverallQual\\', \\'GrLivArea\\', \\'TotalBsmtSF\\']:  # Replace with actual transformed feature names\\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\\n    sns.scatterplot(x=df_valid[feature], y=df_valid[\\'Error\\'])\\n    plt.title(f\\'Error vs. {feature}\\')\\n    plt.xlabel(feature)\\n    plt.ylabel(\\'Prediction Error\\')\\n    plt.savefig(f\\'analyze_errors-{feature}.png\\')\\n\\n\\nStep 19:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1.

Key areas for improvement include exploring different feature selection methods, such as univariate selection or recursive feature elimination, and reconsidering the threshold used in SelectFromModel for a more optimal feature subset. Additionally, the Gradient Boosting model may require re-tuning of hyperparameters post-feature selection to better suit the reduced feature set. Experimenting with different models, including revisiting stacking ensembles with varied base models or meta-learners, could also potentially enhance performance. The balance between feature reduction and retaining informative predictors is crucial and requires careful evaluation.\\nStep 17:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1.

Here\\'s a plan for creating a stacking ensemble:\\n\\nPlan for Stacking Ensemble Method\\nBase Models:\\n\\nUse your existing Gradient Boosting and XGBoost models as the base models. These models have already been trained and evaluated on your data.\\nStacking Method:\\n\\nEmploy a stacking ensemble technique where the base models\\' predictions are used as inputs for a final model, often referred to as a meta-learner.\\nThe meta-learner can be a simpler model, such as a linear regression, which learns how to best combine the predictions from the base models.\\nTraining Process:\\n\\nSplit your dataset into two parts: one for training the base models and another for training the meta-learner.\\nTrain the base models (Gradient Boosting and XGBoost) on the first part of the dataset.\\nUse these models to make predictions on the second part of the dataset. These predictions will form a new dataset, which will be used to train the meta-learner.\\nMeta-Learner Selection:\\n\\nThe choice of meta-learner is crucial. A common choice is a linear regression model, as it\\'s straightforward and often effective in learning the optimal combination of the base modelsâ€™ predictions.\\nAlternatively, you could use a more complex model as the meta-learner if it\\'s justified by improved performance.\\nEvaluation:\\n\\nEvaluate the performance of the stacked model using the same metric (Mean Absolute Error) on a validation set.\\nCompare the performance of the stacked model with the individual base models to ensure that it provides an improvement.\\nImplementation:\\n\\nYou can use the StackingRegressor from scikit-learn to simplify the implementation. This class allows you to define a list of estimators (your base models) and a final estimator (your meta-learner).\\nExample Implementation\\nHereâ€™s a skeleton code for implementing the stacking ensemble:\\n\\npython\\nCopy code\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import StackingRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor\\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\n\\n# Base models\\ngb_model = GradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=42)\\nxgb_model = xgb.XGBRegressor(random_state=42)\\n\\n# Stacking ensemble\\nstacked_model = StackingRegressor(\\n    estimators=[(\\'gradient_boosting\\', gb_model), (\\'xgboost\\', xgb_model)],\\n    final_estimator=LinearRegression()\\n)\\n\\n# Training the stacked model\\nstacked_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\\n\\n# Predictions and evaluation\\nstacked_predictions = stacked_model.predict(X_valid)\\nstacked_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_valid, stacked_predictions)\\nprint(f\"Stacked Model MAE on Validation Set: {stacked_mae}\")\\nFinal Notes\\nThe success of this method depends on how complementary the base models are. If they capture different aspects of the data, stacking can be very effective.\\nFine-tuning the meta-learner and experimenting with different types of meta-learners can further enhance performance.\\nEnsure that the data used to train the meta-learner is not used in training the base models to prevent data leakage.\\nStep 17:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1.

Here is a list of potential improvements:\\n\\n1. Advanced Feature Engineering\\nFeature Interaction Expansion: Expand the current set of interaction terms. Experiment with different degrees in PolynomialFeatures.\\nFeature Selection: Employ techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify and keep only the most impactful features.\\nDomain-Specific Features: If domain knowledge is available, create new features that could be relevant in predicting house prices (e.g., total area, age of the property).\\nTemporal Features: If date or time-related features are present, extract more granular features (e.g., year, month, day, seasonality).\\n2. Model Complexity Adjustment\\nIncrease Model Complexity: Since RandomForest is robust to overfitting, try increasing max_depth or n_estimators further, if computational resources allow.\\nFeature Scaling with Different Models: While RandomForest does not require feature scaling, trying models that are sensitive to feature scale (like SVR or KNN) might yield better results with scaled data.\\n3. Hyperparameter Tuning Refinement\\nRefined Grid Search: Conduct a more focused grid search around the best hyperparameters found (n_estimators: 500, max_depth: 20, etc.).\\nBayesian Optimization: Use Bayesian optimization methods for a more efficient hyperparameter search than Grid or Random search.\\n4. Ensemble Methods\\nStacking: Combine multiple different models using stacking techniques. The blend of models might capture different aspects of the data.\\nBoosting Algorithms: Try boosting algorithms like XGBoost, GradientBoostingRegressor, or LightGBM, which can often yield better performance.\\n5. Additional Data Preprocessing\\nOutlier Removal: Investigate and potentially remove outliers that could be adversely affecting model performance.\\nHandling Skewed Data: Apply transformations like log, square root, or Box-Cox to features that are highly skewed.\\n6. Cross-Validation Strategy\\nFine-Tuning Cross-Validation: Adjust the cross-validation strategy, such as trying different numbers of folds, to ensure the model is generalizing well.\\n7. Deep Learning (If Applicable)\\nNeural Networks: If the dataset is large and complex enough, experimenting with neural networks could be beneficial, although this requires significant computational resources.\\n8. Error Analysis\\nAnalyze Residuals: Dive deeper into the model\\'s residuals to understand where it\\'s making errors and if there\\'s a pattern.\\nAcceptance Criteria\\nImplementation of one or more of these strategies with the aim of improving model performance and reducing MAE below 11,000.\\nRejection Criteria\\nNot exploring new avenues or strategies that can logically contribute to an improvement in model performance.\\nNote\\nEach improvement should be tested iteratively, and the model\\'s performance should be evaluated to ensure that the changes are indeed beneficial.\\nIt\\'s important to remember that achieving an MAE below 11,000 might also depend on the inherent noise and limitations within the dataset itself.\\nStep 12:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1.

Then, I created a plan for hyperparameter tuning. The plan is as follows:\\n\\n    Creating a plan for hyperparameter tuning of a regression model, particularly a RandomForestRegressor in this context, involves a strategic approach to identify key hyperparameters and employing a systematic method for tuning them. The goal is to improve the model\\'s accuracy based on prior reflections on its performance and feature importance rankings. Here\\'s a detailed plan:\\n\\n1. Understand Model Characteristics\\nReview Model: Understand how RandomForestRegressor works, particularly how its hyperparameters influence model performance.\\n2. Identify Key Hyperparameters\\nBased on the RandomForestRegressor, consider the following hyperparameters for tuning:\\n\\nn_estimators: Number of trees in the forest.\\nmax_features: Number of features to consider when looking for the best split.\\nmax_depth: Maximum depth of each tree.\\nmin_samples_split: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\\nmin_samples_leaf: Minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\\n3. Choose a Tuning Method\\nGrid Search: Systematically explore multiple combinations of hyperparameters. Suitable for exploring a comprehensive range of combinations but can be time-consuming.\\nRandom Search: Randomly sample hyperparameter combinations. More efficient than Grid Search, especially when dealing with a large hyperparameter space.\\n4. Define Hyperparameter Space\\nSet up a grid or range for each hyperparameter. For example:\\n\\nn_estimators: [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]\\nmax_features: [\\'auto\\', \\'sqrt\\', \\'log2\\']\\nmax_depth: [None, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\\nmin_samples_split: [2, 5, 10]\\nmin_samples_leaf: [1, 2, 4]\\n5. Implement Tuning Process\\nLoad Data: Load \\'train_engineered.csv\\'.\\nSplit Data: Separate into features and target, and then into training and validation sets.\\nTuning Execution: Utilize GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV from Scikit-learn to explore hyperparameters.\\n6. Evaluation and Selection\\nEvaluate Models: Use a consistent metric, like MAE or RMSE, to evaluate different combinations.\\nSelect Best Parameters: Choose the hyperparameter set that yields the best performance on validation data.\\n7. Post-Tuning Actions\\nTrain Final Model: Train the RandomForestRegressor with the best-found hyperparameters.\\nFinal Evaluation: Evaluate the model on a validation set and compare it with the previous model\\'s performance.\\n8. Documentation\\nRecord Findings: Document the hyperparameter tuning process, findings, and final choice of hyperparameters.\\nAcceptance Criteria\\nA systematic approach to selecting and tuning hyperparameters based on logical reasoning and model performance considerations.\\nRejection Criteria\\nArbitrary selection of hyperparameters without rationale or ignoring the insights gained from feature importance and model performance.\\nAdditional Considerations\\nComputational Resources: Be mindful of the computational intensity, especially with Grid Search.\\nModel Complexity: Avoid overfitting. More complex models aren\\'t always better.\\nIterative Process: Hyperparameter tuning can be an iterative process, and further adjustments might be needed based on ongoing evaluations.\\nStep 10:\\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1. Analyze feature importance and reflect on the current model\\'s performance. 2. Perform feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones. 3. Tune the model\\'s hyperparameters to find a better configuration. 4. Re-train the model and evaluate it using MAE and RMSE on a validation set. 5. If the MAE is below 11,000, prepare the submission.csv with predictions for test.csv. 6. If the MAE is still above 11,000, repeat the feature engineering and model tuning process.\\n\\nI finished reading data_description.txt.

Encoding Strategies\\na. One-Hot Encoding\\nApplicability: Suitable for nominal variables with low cardinality.\\nMethod: Create a new binary column for each category.\\nJustification: Preserves the distinct values without assuming any order, which is ideal for nominal data.\\nb. Label Encoding\\nApplicability: Suitable for ordinal variables where the order is important.\\nMethod: Assign a unique integer to each category based on the order.\\nJustification: Useful for maintaining the inherent order of ordinal data, but should be used cautiously as it may introduce a false sense of magnitude.\\nc. Frequency or Count Encoding\\nApplicability: Useful for high cardinality nominal variables.\\nMethod: Replace categories with their respective counts or frequency of occurrence.\\nJustification: Reduces the complexity of the data, especially useful for variables with many categories.\\nd.

Analyzing the Nature of Missing Data\\nCategorical vs. Numerical Data: Differentiate between categorical and numerical columns, as they require different handling strategies.\\nPercentage of Missingness: Calculate the percentage of missing data for each column (missing_count / total_rows * 100).\\n3. Handling Strategies\\na. Removal\\nDrop Columns: For columns with a high percentage of missing values (e.g., >60%), consider dropping them, especially if they are not significant for analysis or prediction.\\nDrop Rows: For rows with missing values, consider removal if the dataset is large and the number of such rows is relatively small.\\nb. Imputation for Numerical Data\\nMean/Median Imputation: For columns with a low percentage of missingness (e.g., <5%), impute using the mean (for normally distributed data) or median (for skewed data).\\nRegression Imputation: If a numerical column is highly correlated with another numerical column, use regression to predict missing values.\\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation: Use KNN imputation for more complex scenarios where multiple attributes determine the missing value.\\nc. Imputation for Categorical Data\\nMode Imputation: For columns with a low percentage of missingness, impute using the mode (most frequent category).\\nPredictive Modeling: In cases of significant missingness, consider using classification algorithms to predict missing categories based on other features.\\n4. Handling Special Cases\\nFlagging: For columns where missingness is informative (MNAR), create a new binary column indicating the presence or absence of data.\\nTime-Series Data: If \\'train.csv\\' contains time-series data, use time-based imputation methods, like forward fill or backward fill.\\n5. Validation and Analysis Post-Imputation\\nData Distribution Analysis: After imputation, analyze the distribution of data to ensure that the imputation hasn\\'t significantly altered it.\\nModel Performance Comparison: Compare model performance using data before and after imputation to assess the impact.\\n6. Documentation\\nRecord Keeping: Document each action taken for reproducibility and future reference.\\n7. Future Data Handling Plan\\nData Collection Improvement: Recommend strategies for reducing missing data in future data collection, if applicable.\\n\\nStep 2: \\nAnswer State: The goal is to write a prediction script for the test.csv with a MAE of less than 11,000.\\n\\nThe best plan for this is: 1. Read and summarize \\'data_description.txt\\' to understand the dataset\\'s variables. 2. Read \\'research_problem.txt\\' to align the approach with the competition\\'s objectives. 3. Perform exploratory data analysis on \\'train.csv\\' to understand the data distribution and identify patterns. 4. Preprocess the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. 5. Train a regression model using \\'train.csv\\'. 6. Evaluate the model using MAE and RMSE on a validation set. 7. Iterate on feature engineering and model tuning to improve performance. 8. Generate predictions for \\'test.csv\\' and prepare \\'submission.csv\\'.\\n\\nI have finished reading data_description.txt and have a summary in data_description_vars.txt. I think that I already know the research_problem.txt, but if I need to, I can also try to read it. I just completed EDA and have a bunch of figures in my root directory of each file against a target. I also have the following description statistics that might be helpful?\\n\\nDescriptive Statistics:\\n                Id   MSSubClass  LotFrontage        LotArea  OverallQual  OverallCond    YearBuilt  YearRemodAdd   MasVnrArea  ...

It was just 1) getting feedback / reward on the answer state from the environment, 2) the methods agent needs to figure out how to adapt the current plan state so that the outputs when run will generate high reward, 3) executor / simulation actually running the methods agent instructions and giving feedback of the outputs that the methods agent instructed to output, and 4) the curriculum / plan of first having the answer state accomplish an easier task, AND THEN have it try to generate the pen-spinning configurations (2-part plan). The curriculum provides different reward signals via the \"next task\" that it proposes. \n",
