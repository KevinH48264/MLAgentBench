You want a train and validation MAE of lower than 15,000 and there should be a submission.csv containing predictions for test.csv ready to submit.\\\\n\\\\nMetric\\\\nSubmissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.

Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else. \\\\n4) The next task should not be too hard since the internet and I may not contain the full answer in a single article or have learned enough information to complete it yet. \\\\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting based on my current learning progress. I should look for rare and potentially useful pieces of information, upgrade my current answer using better information, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\\\\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks or variations of the task if I need to collect more information to answer more difficult tasks.

For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. You want a train and validation MAE of lower than 15,000 and there should be a submission.csv containing predictions for test.csv ready to submit.\\\\n\\\\nMetric\\\\nSubmissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.

Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else. \\\\n4) The next task should not be too hard since the internet and I may not contain the full answer in a single article or have learned enough information to complete it yet. \\\\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting based on my current learning progress. I should look for rare and potentially useful pieces of information, upgrade my current answer using better information, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\\\\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks or variations of the task if I need to collect more information to answer more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary. \\\\n7) I want to explore the world and discover new things.

You want a train and validation MAE of lower than 15,000 and there should be a submission.csv containing predictions for test.csv ready to submit.\\\\n\\\\nMetric\\\\nSubmissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.

Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else. \\\\n4) The next task should not be too hard since the internet and I may not contain the full answer in a single article or have learned enough information to complete it yet. \\\\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting based on my current learning progress. I should look for rare and potentially useful pieces of information, upgrade my current answer using better information, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\\\\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks or variations of the task if I need to collect more information to answer more difficult tasks.
