You may want to consider using regression models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting to predict the sale prices.\\n\\nSince the evaluation metric is Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price, you should take the logarithm of the sale prices before training your model and make predictions. After making predictions, you can then exponentiate the predicted values to get the actual sale prices.\\n\\nHere\\'s a plan to move forward:\\n1. Read the train.csv and test.csv files to load the datasets into memory.\\n2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.\\n3. Split the train dataset into a training set and a validation set to train and evaluate your model.\\n4. Train different regression models and evaluate their performance using the validation set.\\n5. Select the best-performing model and make predictions on the test dataset.\\n6. Transform the predicted values back to the original scale by exponentiating the logarithm of the predicted sale prices.\\n7.

You may want to consider using regression models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting to predict the sale prices.\\n\\nSince the evaluation metric is Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price, you should take the logarithm of the sale prices before training your model and make predictions. After making predictions, you can then exponentiate the predicted values to get the actual sale prices.\\n\\nHere\\'s a plan to move forward:\\n1. Read the train.csv and test.csv files to load the datasets into memory.\\n2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.\\n3. Split the train dataset into a training set and a validation set to train and evaluate your model.\\n4. Train different regression models and evaluate their performance using the validation set.\\n5. Select the best-performing model and make predictions on the test dataset.\\n6. Transform the predicted values back to the original scale by exponentiating the logarithm of the predicted sale prices.\\n7.
