The goal is to predict the sales price for each house with a train and validation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of lower than 15,000 and to create a submission.csv file containing predictions for test.csv.\\n\\nTo start, you should begin by exploring the data in the train.csv file to understand the features and the target variable (SalePrice). You can use tools like pandas in Python to load the data and perform initial data exploration, including checking for missing values, data types, and statistical summaries.\\n\\nOnce you have a good understanding of the data, you can start preprocessing it by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary. After preprocessing, you can then proceed to build and train a machine learning model to predict the house prices.\\n\\nFor model selection, you can start with simple models like linear regression and then explore more complex models such as random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks to improve the prediction performance.\\n\\nAfter training the model, you can evaluate its performance using the validation set and make necessary adjustments to improve the model\\'s accuracy. Once you are satisfied with the model\\'s performance, you can use it to make predictions on the test set and create the submission.csv file as per the specified format.\\n\\nIf you encounter any specific issues or need assistance with any of the steps, feel free to provide more details, and I can provide further guidance.\\n\\nStep: 2\\nFiles: [\\'data_description.txt\\', \\'research_problem.txt\\', \\'sample_submission.csv\\', \\'sample_submission.csv.gz\\', \\'test.csv\\', \\'test.csv.gz\\', \\'train.csv\\', \\'train.csv.gz\\']\\nAction: Calling function wrapped_complete_text_openai(args = (), kwargs = {\\'system_prompt\\': \"You are a helpful assistant and a first-rate problem solver.

      "Answer: Given the research problem and the available files, it seems like you are working on a machine learning project to predict house prices using the Ames, Iowa dataset. The goal is to predict the sales price for each house with a train and validation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of lower than 15,000 and to create a submission.csv file containing predictions for test.csv.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start, you should begin by exploring the data in the train.csv file to understand the features and the target variable (SalePrice). You can use tools like pandas in Python to load the data and perform initial data exploration, including checking for missing values, data types, and statistical summaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you have a good understanding of the data, you can start preprocessing it by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary. After preprocessing, you can then proceed to build and train a machine learning model to predict the house prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "For model selection, you can start with simple models like linear regression and then explore more complex models such as random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks to improve the prediction performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using the validation set and make necessary adjustments to improve the model's accuracy. Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can use it to make predictions on the test set and create the submission.csv file as per the specified format.\n",

The goal is to predict the sales price for each house with a train and validation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of lower than 15,000 and to create a submission.csv file containing predictions for test.csv.\\n\\nTo start, you should begin by exploring the data in the train.csv file to understand the features and the target variable (SalePrice). You can use tools like pandas in Python to load the data and perform initial data exploration, including checking for missing values, data types, and statistical summaries.\\n\\nOnce you have a good understanding of the data, you can start preprocessing it by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary. After preprocessing, you can then proceed to build and train a machine learning model to predict the house prices.\\n\\nFor model selection, you can start with simple models like linear regression and then explore more complex models such as random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks to improve the prediction performance.\\n\\nAfter training the model, you can evaluate its performance using the validation set and make necessary adjustments to improve the model\\'s accuracy. Once you are satisfied with the model\\'s performance, you can use it to make predictions on the test set and create the submission.csv file as per the specified format.\\n\\nIf you encounter any specific issues or need assistance with any of the steps, feel free to provide more details, and I can provide further guidance.\\n\\nStep: 2\\nFiles: [\\'data_description.txt\\', \\'research_problem.txt\\', \\'sample_submission.csv\\', \\'sample_submission.csv.gz\\', \\'test.csv\\', \\'test.csv.gz\\', \\'train.csv\\', \\'train.csv.gz\\']\\nAction: Calling function wrapped_complete_text_openai(args = (), kwargs = {\\'system_prompt\\': \"You are a helpful assistant and a first-rate problem solver.

You want a train and validation MAE of lower than 15,000 and there should be a submission.csv containing predictions for test.csv ready to submit.\\\\n\\\\nMetric\\\\nSubmissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.

The goal is to predict the sales price for each house with a train and validation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of lower than 15,000 and to create a submission.csv file containing predictions for test.csv.\\n\\nTo start, you should begin by exploring the data in the train.csv file to understand the features and the target variable (SalePrice). You can use tools like pandas in Python to load the data and perform initial data exploration, including checking for missing values, data types, and statistical summaries.\\n\\nOnce you have a good understanding of the data, you can start preprocessing it by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary. After preprocessing, you can then proceed to build and train a machine learning model to predict the house prices.\\n\\nFor model selection, you can start with simple models like linear regression and then explore more complex models such as random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks to improve the prediction performance.\\n\\nAfter training the model, you can evaluate its performance using the validation set and make necessary adjustments to improve the model\\'s accuracy. Once you are satisfied with the model\\'s performance, you can use it to make predictions on the test set and create the submission.csv file as per the specified format.\\n\\nIf you encounter any specific issues or need assistance with any of the steps, feel free to provide more details, and I can provide further guidance.\\n\\nStep: 2\\nFiles: [\\'data_description.txt\\', \\'research_problem.txt\\', \\'sample_submission.csv\\', \\'sample_submission.csv.gz\\', \\'test.csv\\', \\'test.csv.gz\\', \\'train.csv\\', \\'train.csv.gz\\']\\nAction: Calling function wrapped_complete_text_openai(args = (), kwargs = {\\'system_prompt\\': \"You are a helpful assistant and a first-rate problem solver.

The goal is to predict the sales price for each house with a train and validation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of lower than 15,000 and to create a submission.csv file containing predictions for test.csv.\\\\n\\\\nTo start, you should begin by exploring the data in the train.csv file to understand the features and the target variable (SalePrice). You can use tools like pandas in Python to load the data and perform initial data exploration, including checking for missing values, data types, and statistical summaries.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have a good understanding of the data, you can start preprocessing it by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary. After preprocessing, you can then proceed to build and train a machine learning model to predict the house prices.\\\\n\\\\nFor model selection, you can start with simple models like linear regression and then explore more complex models such as random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks to improve the prediction performance.\\\\n\\\\nAfter training the model, you can evaluate its performance using the validation set and make necessary adjustments to improve the model\\\\\\'s accuracy. Once you are satisfied with the model\\\\\\'s performance, you can use it to make predictions on the test set and create the submission.csv file as per the specified format.\\\\n\\\\nIf you encounter any specific issues or need assistance with any of the steps, feel free to provide more details, and I can provide further guidance.\\\\n\\\\nStep: 2\\\\nFiles: [\\\\\\'data_description.txt\\\\\\', \\\\\\'research_problem.txt\\\\\\', \\\\\\'sample_submission.csv\\\\\\', \\\\\\'sample_submission.csv.gz\\\\\\', \\\\\\'test.csv\\\\\\', \\\\\\'test.csv.gz\\\\\\', \\\\\\'train.csv\\\\\\', \\\\\\'train.csv.gz\\\\\\']\\\\nAction: Calling function wrapped_complete_text_openai(args = (), kwargs = {\\\\\\'system_prompt\\\\\\': \"You are a helpful assistant and a first-rate problem solver.
