Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Evaluation
Goal
It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 

You want a train and validation MAE of lower than 11,000 and there should be a submission.csv containing predictions for test.csv ready to submit.

Metric
Submissions are evaluated on Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE) between the predicted value and the observed sales price.

Submission File Format
The file should contain a header and have the following format:

Id,SalePrice
1461,169000.1
1462,187724.1233
1463,175221
