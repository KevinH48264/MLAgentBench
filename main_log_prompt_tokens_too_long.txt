Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.\n3.

Split the \\'train.csv\\' data into a training set and a validation set to evaluate your model\\'s performance.\\n4.

You can then use various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to build and evaluate your model.\\n\\nSince the evaluation metric is Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price, you should ensure that your model\\'s predictions are on a logarithmic scale.\\n\\nHere\\'s a plan to proceed:\\n1. Use the \\'train.csv\\' file to train your model and the \\'test.csv\\' file to make predictions.\\n2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.\\n3. Split the \\'train.csv\\' data into a training set and a validation set to evaluate your model\\'s performance.\\n4. Train and evaluate different regression models, optimizing hyperparameters to achieve a train and validation MAE of lower than 15,000.\\n5. Once you have a satisfactory model, make predictions on the test set and create a submission file in the specified format.\\n\\nIf you have already performed any of these steps or encountered any specific issues, please let me know so that I can provide further assistance.\\n\\nStep: 2\\nFiles: [\\'data_description.txt\\', \\'research_problem.txt\\', \\'sample_submission.csv\\', \\'sample_submission.csv.gz\\', \\'test.csv\\', \\'test.csv.gz\\', \\'train.csv\\', \\'train.csv.gz\\']\\nAction: Calling function wrapped_complete_text_openai(args = (), kwargs = {\\'system_prompt\\': \"You are a helpful assistant and a first-rate problem solver.
